    "summary": "Jujutsu Kaisen season 2, spanning 2006-2018, opens with a flashback to 16-year-old Gojo, lacking the skills of his later self.  His classmate, Suguru Geto, possessed the incredibly adaptable Curse Spirit Manipulation, allowing him to absorb and control countless curses.  Geto's motivation stemmed from a desire to protect non-sorcerers, fueled by his friendship with Gojo.\n\nTheir mission to protect Riko Amanai, the current Star Plasma Vessel, unravels.  Riko's life is threatened by Q, an organization seeking to force the immortal sorcerer Tengen's evolution, and the Time Vessel Association, who worship Tengen and oppose her merging with a human.  Toji Fushiguro, a powerful, cursed-energy-less assassin, targets Riko.  Geto saves Riko from Q, but Toji, exploiting Gojo's exhaustion from protecting Riko from a bounty, kills Gojo and then Riko.\n\nGeto's near-death experience leads him to master Reverse Curse Technique.  Gojo's subsequent defeat of Toji reveals Toji's abused past and his son, Megumi, sold to the Zenin clan.  Geto's disillusionment with humanity deepens, culminating in a massacre, leading him down a path of creating a sorcerer-only society.\n\nMeanwhile, Mahito's group aims to replace humanity with curses, targeting Gojo.  They trap Gojo in a Prison Realm, orchestrated by Geto, who is later revealed to be alive thanks to his body being stolen and his consciousness transferred by Noritoshi Kamo.  The Shibuya Incident ensues, involving multiple battles and the temporary possession of Yuji Itadori by Sukuna.  The incident reveals the extent of Geto's plan and the public's awareness of curses.  The aftermath leaves Gojo sealed, Yuji slated for execution, and Jujutsu Society in turmoil."
