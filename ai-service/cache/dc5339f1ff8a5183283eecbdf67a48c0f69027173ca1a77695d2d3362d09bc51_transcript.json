from start to finish in chological order so it's very simple to follow along throughout the video there will also be a timeline animation at the bottom of the screen so you can easily keep track of exactly when are certain events taking place in order to start from the very beginning we need to go back around 5,000 years when Oh's great tree of omniscience was planted in the ground and became the foundation for the library then a thousand years after that alabara Palace was constructed and thus began the kingdom of alabasta it was established when a person named cahita conquered Sandy Island a calendar starting at year Zer was established 1,524 years before the main story which is going to make keeping track of everything much simpler from now on the next thing we know is that around year 400 the moon people were beginning to run out of resources and decided to migrate down to the blue star on the moon they lived in a giant city called burka they were highly Advanced and had even built a legion of robot-like creatures called automatas when they arrived on Earth the three Moon people tribes split up the birkens and the skypan decided to stay on the sky islands while the shorians decided to live on G then around the year 500 a huge elephant named zunesha was born somewhere in the new world this was also around the same time the long arm tribe and the longle tribe

game in the year 600 the dress Rosa Palace was built the country was established and governed by the donot family that lived on Dres Rosa Island at the time King donot was soon visited by a traveling band of dwarves called tonadas who left their Homeland behind in order to search for resources and Shelter by pretending to care and offering to help the king Enslaved the tonat tribe for centuries and forced them to build Dres Rosa into a prosperous City although not confirmed the ancient kingdom was was most likely established around the same time with several nations of the world coming together to share their technological advancements the people of this Kingdom had access to the three ancient weapons which are rumored to have Godly Powers another thing that most likely happened before the void Century began was the creation of devil fruits as Vega Punk explained they were brought into existence by people's unfulfilled wishes and desires for the future the one piece World also established a Global Currency at the time called Barry after berries became a thing the era of slaves began the slaves in the oppress came to idolize and prayed to the Sun God who they believed would come to liberate them from their oppressors somewhere around this time a person called Joy boy who wore a straw hat set out to see and became the first pirate at some point he also ate the devil fruit called the hitoo noi model naika during his travels Joy boy befriended zunes and The Iron Giant EMT back then fishmen Island was the only place where fishmen gathered in order to bask in the sunlight that came from the Sun tree Eve it was a settlement they established under the sea to avoid the persecution they faced on land Joy boy visited the island in proed he'd raise the giant ship Noah to the surface a promise he was not able to keep for an unknown reason during his journeys Joy boy arrived on a certain island in the new world which would later be known as laugh Tale on it Joy booy hit his treasure although we don't know what it is it was described as something that could completely turn the world upside down after that Joy boy had a citizen of wano write the poneglyphs for him with one outlining his apology to the fishermen for not being able to fulfill his promise and promising that someone would fulfill it in the future he left another message at the unnamed Island claiming that he would return in 800 years a few years later for some reason 20 kingdoms around the world banded together and waged war against joy booy in an effort to kill him and destroy the ancient Kingdom this new Coalition of Kingdoms eventually succeeded but before their demise Joy booy's allies managed to hide the ancient weapons so they wouldn't end up in the wrong hands sometime before his defeat Joy boy locked a huge amount of his hockey inside of EMT and told him to use it in the future if he's in danger or wants to save somebody else zunesha might have also played a role in Joy boy's downfall since the elephant was cursed to wander the Seas for eternity as punishment for its betrayal due to the events of this war the world's water level also Rose by 200 M sinking many continents in the process after achieving their goal the 20 Kings wiped out the lunarians that lived in the god country of lunaria on top of the red line and moved with their families there there they established their Capital City Mar joa and became known as the world Nobles or the celestial dragons however one of those Nobles decided that living on top of the world and acting as a god wasn't really her thing so she decided to stay back on the mainland instead that person was neerati D Lily the princess of alabasta Kingdom who defected from the 20 kingdoms Coalition and became responsible for spreading poneglyphs detailing the Real History of the World Around The Sea after this she mysteriously vanished at Sea and never returned to alabasta she's also the first ever person to have the moniker of D any documents that mentioned her were immediately destroyed and her younger brother became the new king following these events the Coalition of 20 kingdoms rebranded as the world government and started erasing from history everything that's happened in the last 100 years including Joy boy with Will of D the ancient Kingdom and the ancient weapons this erased part of History became known as the void century and any Research into it was considered one of the worst crimes possible punishable by death since the donot royal family left dress Rosa to live on the red line the rku family took over and fostered a healthy sincere relationship with the tonata tribe during this time Joy boy's allies and wano hid pluton away inside wano's underground Caverns the water seven ship rides who built plutone also decided to hide the existence of the weapons blueprints while Fishman Island protected Poseidon and Noah with their lives this was also presumably done to preserve these weapons for Joy boy's eventual return led by the mysterious figure emu who's believed to be one of the 20 Kings the world government would go on to rule the world with an iron fist for the next 800 years anise Lobby was built to carry out the world government's judicial procedures while Cipher poles were established to act as the government's intelligence agencies noticing the rising water level around the year 800 the world government started the construction of massive bridges known as tequila wolf vodka wolf rum wolf and bourbon Wolf the construction was done by slaves from the countries that didn't submit to the government's rule at some point close to the year 1000 an ancient giant named ores was born he was larger than any current known Giant in the story and was called the continent polar Legend has it that he amassed countries and Islands under his control and his band of villains eventually orz froze to death somewhere near the northern pole as he was unprepared for the Frozen climate having worn only a loin cloth it's estimated that around the year 1,100 a giant dragon laid sieged to the country of wano and was later cut down by the legendary swordsman sword god shimotsuki uduma with his great blade shusui then in the year 1,122 an adventurer and botanist named Montblanc Nolan went on an expedition on the grand line during his travels he saved the tonadas on green bit against tyrants who were terrorizing their island eventually he wound up making landfall on the shores of Gia after befriending a local girl and saving her from becoming a sacrifice to some giant snake Nolan convinced her father to let him treat the shandians who were dying from the tree fever plague in exchange for his treatment the shandians let Nolan visit the lost city of gold shandia and grew very fond of him four years later the knockup stream launched shandia all the way up to skypia the skypan saw shandia as a sacred land rich with resources and decided to invade this started a 400-year war between the two tribes meanwhile Nolan came home and told the king of LEL about the ancient city of gold that he had found intrigued the king wanted to go to G and see it for himself unaware that the island was now in the sky Nolan led the king there only to realize that the city and its people had disappeared thinking that Nolan made the entire thing up the Furious King ordered his execution Nolan was Brandon Nolan the liar and his family was ridiculed and exiled from the kingdom another two centuries later EMT The Iron Giant Joy boy was friends with mysteriously awakens and starts riging havoc on Mary joah but before he could do any large scale damage he ran out of power and turned off St Saturn tked His science division to hide the robot and research it in secret even though they had clear orders from the world government to destroy it somewhere around around the year 1,400 the pirate group known as the Giant Warrior Pirates lay waste all over the grand line it was around the same time that a giant named Morley was captured and imprisoned in level five of impel down using his devil fruit abilities he made his Escape in secret and created tunnels that came to be known as level 5.5 of the prison meanwhile the co- captains of the Giant Warrior Pirates Dori and broi had a disagreement and began their legendary 100-year duel on little garden without their captains the rest of the crew were captured and almost executed by the world government however before that Could Happen mother Carmel advocated for the release and safely brought them back to elbat then working together with Cipher Poole Carmel opened an orphanage on the island to export orphan children as slaves around the same time the kingdom of flaven started mining white Amber lead despite finding out that it's poisonous to humans I'm sure this won't have any serious consequences in the future anyways in 1,443 on wano the lord of the korumi family poisoned four other Lords in order to gain power over the region and become Shogun un fortunately for him an heir to the kuki family was born which derailed his plans for Ascension following the uncovering of his plot the Lord committed sepu out of Shame while the rest of the family was hunted down and killed on the spot the Sphinx Island became too poor to be affiliated with the world government around the year 1450 the resulting chaos LED Edward nugate who was born in that year to become an orphan 7 years after that somewhere in the new world harus constructed weria and decided to study the weather on the floating island with his colleague a few years later in 1461 at elath Charlotte linling gets abandoned by her parents which results in her being taken to Mother caramel's orphanage after struggling to control herself through a fast Lyn goes on a destructive spree and winds up killing one of the former Giant Warrior pirate captains jeru Furious the Giants eventually decided to let linlin live at the behest of mother caramel but with the condition to move her orphanage to another Island a year later during another one of her hunger pains linlin ends up eating all of her fellow orphans along with Mother Carl this resulted in her getting the powers of the sodu sodu noi which was the devil fruit mother carade in the past after sometime lenlin came across a young pirate named struin who saw potential in her powers and decided to team up with her in 1469 the legendary sword maker from wano Kabuto decided to leave the country with 24 other people despite not being allowed to the group then traveled to the east blue upon arrival Kabuto drove away a bunch of Bandits with the help of the locals and founded shimotsuki Village a year later kurumi Orochi is born and lives a hard life because of being persecuted for his lineage on a mission to find their captains in 1472 the Giants oo and Kashi get duped into becoming The Gatekeepers of Anis Lobby by the world government who lied about releasing their captured captains if they do so in reality Dori and Bogi were still dueling on little Garden in the same year the rumar Pirates came across a lost whale baboon near the entrance to the Grand line after making friends with the whale the crew promised baboon that they would be back and continued their Journey however not long after that in 1474 the rumar Pirates met their abrupt end on the grand line after losing their Captain to an illness and being showered by an avalanche of poisoned arrows however due to his re devil fruit Brooke was the only member of the crew to survive at the same time Goldie Roger was making a name for himself as a strong rookie pirate along with his right-and man silveri soon after forming a crew they had Tom a ship right from water 7 construct an amazing ship for them made out of wood from the treasure tree Adam named the Yoto Jackson A year later in the Vodka Kingdom a child named kaido turned 10 years old and was already considered the Kingdom's strongest Soldier the year 1480 was the start of the era of rocks the famous pirate Rox D zic OCC IED an island named Hai nasu and started Gathering the strongest pirates for his crew there that same year Edward Newgate now known as Whitebeard met kaido on haachi nasu and convinced him to join Rock's crew together linlin also joined Rock's crew at a similar time a year after that Kuma and his family had their blood test details leaked and wound up being sold off as slaves to the celestial dragons for being Buccaneers this resulted in both of Kuma's parents dying during the next four years during that time a couple more things happened a group of settlers founded orange town on the East Blue shakuyaku retired as a pirate and opened up her own bar on sa archipelago while kurumi Higurashi returned to wano in order to Stage a coup with a young Orochi then finally in 1485 Roger and his crew finally reached loar the last Island that the log pose pointed to around that time the rich emperor of the underground called leld founded the Mad Science group the members of this group were Cen Vega Punk judge Caesar and Buckingham Stuy and the group did illegal scientific research in wano kosaki Odin finally received the title of Lord for taking over and reforming a lawless region of the island called toui a year later the celestial dragons somehow got hold of devil fruits stolen from haosu they put them up as a prize for the winner of their hunting tournament on God Valley angry at the government roxs and his crew decide to invade the island in order to retrieve their devil fruits learning that rock is on the island Roger Pirates arrive as well which started a legendary duel between the two Crews eventually Monkey D GARP sided with Roger and together they managed to take rocks down during the conflict the three slaves jinny Kuma and ianov managed to fre themselves and steal the devil fruits that were meant to be the tournament's prizes linlin suddenly appeared and managed to steal the oui no me even COV was holding but before she could do the same tokuma the boy managed to eat it in the aftermath it was confirmed that roxs allegedly died during the battle and his name was completely erased from history also the entire Island was destroyed by the government while making his Escape Roger found a baby in one of the chests he plundered and decided to name him Shanks with the era of rocks finished the era of Rogers started after the legendary battle on gods Valley GARP was given all the credit for Rock's downfall and was named hero of the Marines at some point after the god Valley incident kaido was in prisoned and taken to punk Hazard where Dr Vega Punk experimented on him in order to clone his devil fruit however it was unsuccessful and kaido managed to escape while also freeing Arbor Arbor is one of the few lunarians left in the world after the world government exterminated them during the void Century after escaping together kaido told Arbor that he was planning on starting his own crew and asked him to join him thus the Beast Pirates were formed in the meantime other former members of Rock's crew linlin and Whitebeard also decided to start their own Cruise creating the big bomb Pirates and the Whitebeard pirates in 1491 the donot family consisting of doflamingo his brother rosinante Mother and Father renounced their titles as Celestial dragons and decided to live the rest of their lives with other humans however they soon got punished for their lineage and were driven into a life of poverty to add to doflamingo's misery his mother died from an illness after escaping from God Valley Kuma and jinny settled down in the sorbic Kingdom there Kuma used his devil fruit powers to help the elderly people of the Kingdom by enduring their pain for them in 1494 kuki Odin finally managed to get his chance to leave the country after being visited by whitebeard's crew after enduring a tough trial the samurai saves Toki and gains permission to join the crew with Odin out at the sea kaido Revo with his old Ally Higurashi on wano and conspires to take over the country two years later in 1496 Roger gets a fatal illness that shortens his lifespan greatly this prompts him to recruit crocus as a ship's doctor and set sail for one last Grand Adventure this same year Nigo ovia sets out to see in order to research the poneglyphs and doflamingo kills his own father by the next year Roger faced off against Golden Lion Shiki an extremely dangerous pirate who boasted a massive Armada they faced off in the massive battle known as the Eddy War their battle was cut short however after a weather incident destroyed half of shiki's forces and lodged a ship's steering wheel permanently into the back of his head in 1498 Cen one of the former mads members abandons his 10-year-old child and decides to join the Beast Pirates changing his name to Queen coincidentally an ex exactly the same time a 10-year-old boy named cdy flam is found abandoned at Sea by the famous ship right Tom I'll let you make your own conclusions about that anyway the Roger Pirates Clash off on an epic battle against the Whitebeard pirates that lasts 3 days and three nights by the end of it Rogers formally as s and to join his crew after asking Whitebeard for permission inashi and nekomamushi decide to tag along too within the span of a few short months the crew reaches the ponent glyphs at skypia and Odin is asked to write Roger's message on it Rogers also visits zo and inspire as a young Pedro during that time mads was officially dissolved and baros solino was sent to arrest Vega Punk however Vega Punk wasn't phased by this because he knew that the government actually wanted to hire him as their own scientists rather than arrest him this is eventually what happened with both Vega Punk and Caesar Clown joining the government's research team he later adopted Catu and made him his bodyguard after he was exiled from his village for being too strong Bolino who has by now become a good friend of VAP Punk decided to train the boy whilst working for the government VAP Punk received a visit from Professor Clover of ohada who begged him for his help with uncovering the truth behind the poneglyphs Dr Vega Punk promptly refused another year later Monkey D Dragon started a paramilitary mercenary group of pirates called the Freedom Fighters they staged several protests across the world and inspired people like Kuma to fight for the oppressed they also asked Vega Punk to join their cause but again he refused in the same year the Roger Pirates finally finished their grand voyage and conquered the grand line by making it all the way to laugh taale with Odin's help while they were celebrating however Odin's country wano was facing a coup by the Beast pirates that almost led to the death of Odin's wife and child shortly after the end of their Journey the Roger Pirates disbanded and all of them went their own separate ways with their Captain turning himself into the Marines while imprisoned Roger asked his longtime rival GARP to take care of his son Ace GARP of course accepted Upon returning to wano Odin realized what had happened in his absence and immediately rushed to kill odoi but before he could do that odoi threatened to kill a bunch of civilians he then says that if Odin dances naked in the flower Capital once a week they'll be spared he also promises Odin that he and kaido would leave wano in 5 years in order to save as many people as possible Odin danced in the capital every week causing the people of wano to lose faith and respect for him meanwhile Shiki invades Marine Ford furious at the thought that Roger was captured by the Marines asking sangoku to bring him out so Shiki could kill him himself this led to a huge scale battle where Shiki took on both sangoku and gar he eventually lost and was sent to impel down the following week Roger was set to be executed in his hometown lown on the platform as the blades were about to impale him Roger was asked a question by someone in the crowd about the location of his hidden treasure while laughing Roger looked down at the crowd and said you want my treasure well you can have it I've left everything the world has to offer there the one piece Roger's words ignited a flame inside the hearts of the common folk and they kickstarted the great pirate era where more Pirates started popping up than ever before all with the goal of finding Roger's legendary treasure it's unknown when but soon after Roger's death Shanks went and formed a crew of his own called the red-haired Pirates and he even invited buggy to join him but was turned down soon Odin receives the news of Roger's death and weeps at the loss of his friend the next year geeko Maria a famous rookie pirate invaded wano and stole Roma's body and his blade shisui Moria and kaido's forces clashed with each other but in the

after coming face to face with his old friend Kuan the giant is Frozen in place while Kuan spares Robin's life and allows her to escape in the end the island is completely destroyed and all of its inhabitants massacred however before they completely perished the residents of ohada threw as many books as they could in the water in order to preserve all the information they uncovered about the world the events of that day would later come to be known as the ohada incident a couple of more notable things that happened during this are that gun got trapped inside a treasure chest Shiki escaped impelled down after cutting off his own legs and Roger's son Ace was born but his wife died somewhere in the South Blue after giving birth anyways Kuma finally gets fed up with the king of sorbet ruthless actions and decides to retaliate but gets promptly captured with Jenny and put in prison sometime later Monkey D dragon and iov freed Kuma and jinny from the jail cell and help them make the king back off they Rebrand the Freedom Fighters as the Revolutionary army they did this not only to ramp up their efforts to dismantle the government but also to commemorate the massacre of ohada a few months later Vega Punk decides to visit ohada to put flowers on Professor Clover's grave after coming upon a lake he's shocked to witness the Giants from elath Gathering all the books that were thrown out into the water dragon meets Vega Punk there and explains that the Giants were saving these books because they're aware of the value they hold following their talk the scientist laments over

with his strength however before he could deal a finishing blow he was tricked by higashi which allowed kaido to defeat him Odin and his retainers were then imprisoned and sentenced to be boiled alive however Odin made a deal with kaido that anyone who survives the execution for more than an hour would be allowed to walk free on the day of the execution Odin lifted a plank on his shoulders and ordered his retainers to stand on top of the plank proceeding to hold them all up out of Harm's Way although he survived more than an hour he was still executed but not before throwing his retainers

for blueprints of the ancient weapon pluton after losing a fight to Rob Luchi Luffy and the crew fail to retrieve Robin from them also cp9 agents figure out that Frankie is actually cdy flam and that he most likely has the blueprints that they're looking for after paying him a visit they kidnap both him and Usopp and take them with them to any's Lobby via sea train thankfully Sanji manages to

to train under mihawk Nami being teleported to weria science weather is her thing and Robin being sent to meet the Revolutionary Army for obvious reasons it's also during that time that news of Ace's

Akino assumed soku's place as Fleet Admiral the Marines then transferred their base of operations to the new world and enlisted two new Admirals fujitora and green bull sword is also formed around this time it's weird to explain but B basically sword is a group of Marines who can do pretty much whatever they want without having to listen to orders from the world government but they also aren't recognized as actual Marines so if they make a mess they won't get help from the Navy since it's not their problem with their Captain dead the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates did their best to exact revenge on Blackbeard But ultimately failed and gave up the pursuit entirely following this battle Blackbeard acquired most of whitebeard's former territories and Islands he then made it his
