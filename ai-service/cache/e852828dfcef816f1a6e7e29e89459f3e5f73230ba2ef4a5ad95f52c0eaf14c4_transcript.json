{"transcript": " This video isn't spired by Austin McConnell. I originally followed him for his advice on filmmaking, but then I quickly realized that his channel spans everything and anything. And he's definitely worth subscribing to if you're interested in anything and everything all at the same time. Now, seriously, he does. On his YouTube channel is 10 minutes of useless information. And I personally absolutely love useless information. In fact, it's my favorite type of information. So I thought I would bring that concept over into Minecraft. So prepare for these next 10 minutes to be incredibly mildly interesting. Last noise is originate from C418's Cat, which he makes when disturbed while sleeping. On planetmindcraft.com, the 10th most downloaded map of all time is Hillside Manorworld, in brackets 1.8, 4 year anniversary, created by Inhaze, with over 700,000 downloads. In Minecraft Beta 1.14, the open inventory key was changed from being I to being E. It takes this long to fall 102 blocks. Nice. There are 15 different types of villager professions. Regular walking speed in Minecraft is 4.3 blocks per second. In the original version of the Minecraft Steve Skinne, Steve actually had a bit. This was removed in the 0.24 underscores of I will underscore test version of Minecraft. There was released on September 1st, 2009. A melon block will always drop between 3 and 7 slices. Wow, we actually got lucky there. A villagers forehead is 5 pixels high. Meaning the village of Lidishley has a 5 head. The Minecraft credits roll for an incredibly interesting 27 minutes and 15 seconds. Minecraft 1.13.2 was released on the 22nd of October 2018. It takes this long to break a gold pickaxe that has been enchanted with efficiency 3. And he's second now. And he's second now. As of Minecraft snapshot 20w45A, the longest item name is Wanks, the likely weathered cat copper stairs. When a puff of fish puffs up, it expands to 0.7 blocks by 0.7 blocks giving it a volume of 0.49 blocks. Huge, the dead bush was introduced on May 25th, 2011. On the Reddit post, what's your least favorite block in Minecraft, the top voted comment was direite. And that comment was not made by a scout. The longest Minecraft username you can have is 16 characters. I've just opened up the Minecraft Java Edition title screen and this is what the little yellow text says. If you change your language to pirates, then another white shovel becomes black beard spade. A piston becomes a raised deck and chisel sandstone becomes cast stone a sand. This is what the world seed I have very long legs looks like. That might take a little while. For the world's generate, you know, this is not something I really thought about. The fact that I would have to fill in this space by talking, but you know we're getting there, 50%, 70%, 90% and here it is. That's rather lovely, actually. If I jump off this 23 block high platform with my head tilted 18 degrees downwards, wearing an alletra, this is how far I go. Splendid. There are 3,264 pixels on a Minecraft skin. Eight of which are made up by my mustache. If I generate a new world with a bonus chest, this is what arrives in my bonus chest. There it is. Let's see what we've got. Huh. I actually a lot better than I ever imagined. You know, I've never played with a bonus chest before. If the Minecraft Steve character model was a real person, then his biceps will be 39.5 inches around. Which is ridiculous, but that I'm perspective Arnold had 22 inch biceps in his heyday. Hang on a minute, did I just give you some useless information which wasn't minecraft related? That's illegal. In the top left hand corner of the F3 screen, you can see a 2-jid number followed by the letters TX. And this means the number of packets that have been sent by your Minecraft client. This is what a field of view of 104 with speed 1 looks like. The music disc can't has a runtime of 3 minutes and 5 seconds. And honestly, I kind of wish it was longer. I absolutely love this song. You used to be able to take huge Minecraft screenshots that were the equivalent of a 645 megapixel photo, which is frankly obscene. Lady Agnes joined Mojang on August the 3rd 2016. The wild seed that was used for the packed.png image was 32578403880495. And it was discovered by a huge team of people. This is what the packed.png seed looks like when generated in Minecraft 1.16. If you have 36 apples and you have 6 meats sticks to fill out, then you will be left. With 33 apples, the 47th item listed in the decoration block segment of the creative menu is the chorus flower. The redstone lamp has 30 different segments in total. With 5 segments on every face, it takes this long for me to open my Minecraft redstone testing world. There's actually a lot faster than I was expecting it to be. It takes 6 blocks to craft 4 stairs. So that means that each stair costs 1.5 blocks, despite the fact that stairs are 0.75 blocks. This is what the clouds currently look like directly above my head. I'm going to be honest with you, it's incredibly unexciting. The title of the third category in the advancements window is husbandry. It takes this long to die from drowning when you don't have any protective armor or anything to stop you from dying a horrible painful death. And what we honest is a bit of a slow death as well. I gradually my breath is running out, I fill myself gasping for air, now I'm inhaling water. My lungs are filling with fluid. I can feel the world closing in around me. I'm on death's door. And now I'm gone, that's a horrible way to go. Things got a little bit dark, they didn't make. There are 471 items in 7 stacks and 23 items. This is a very odd redstone circuit, but I recently found in my redstone test as well. And I can't work out the life of me what is meant to do. The 14th fastest random seed Minecraft 1.16 plus speedrunner is by Julius the Tiny Dog. I've had 20 minutes and 32 seconds, placing 11 pieces of TNT 1 block apart creates an explosion that looks a little bit like this. It's very mildly satisfying, isn't it? This is one 8 tick redstone clock looks like. If I right click this note block 10 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And this one 6 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and play them both at the same time. This is what it sounds like. awful. You cannot put a shoulder box inside another shoulder box, no matter how hard you try. Setting the random tick speed to 421 makes bamboo grow incredibly quickly. I mean look at that. If you dig straight down on seed 991, 62322, a coordinates x206 and z. 19, you will not fall into lava. If you set the time to 43,690, this is what it looks like. Before block IDs were totally phased out from the game, the block ID of Iron All was 50. It takes this long to climb 11 blocks on a ladder. A really bad orientation is a specific location. So say for example, I've placed a really bad in this corner here. It will always face in this direction. No matter what I do, even if I place it like this, I can do whatever I like. Nothing is going to be able to change it. If you shoot an arrow directly upwards, it won't always land on your head. But sometimes it does. Not today. Iron used potion effect called nausea. This is what it looks like. I can totally understand why they don't use it because I'll be honest, it's making my brain hurt quite a bit already. I'm going to Minecraft snapshot 17W43A. You could play Minecraft in 3D stereoscope. The Minecraft username, hello with 7-Os after it, is actually available right now. Although I imagine it won't be for long. There are 4 varieties and horse-hurt sounds, but there is only one sound for a horse dying. It's around us. 3 Snow layers is 3-8th of a block tall. Falling into the void even kills you in creative mode. But it does give you a cool view of the underside of the world as it happens. You can't see your own legs when playing in fast-pass mode. On seed 2112, there's a blacksmith with a chest located at x595, z211. These are all the items that are on the inside of it. Some flowers in Minecraft will always face east. You can actually place redstone components on the sides and on the top of pistons, but as soon as the piston extends, they get broken. It takes between 5 seconds and 45 seconds to catch a fish in Minecraft. Unfortunately, there's no way of knowing if it's going to be 5 seconds or 45 seconds or anything in between until you cast your rod into the water. There's nothing going on right now. My bobber is just sitting there. Waiting. Waiting. I almost missed it. 5 minutes to catch myself above a fish. Contrary to what a lot of people seem to believe, you cannot actually push a barrel making use of pistons. Pumpkin Pi has a 100% full rate when it comes to composters. That means every single time you put a pumpkin Pi in there, it is guaranteed to increase the level of the composter. Whereas Beatrice's, then you have a 30% chance of increasing the level. And wow, are we getting unlucky? It takes 81 pieces of regular ice to craft just one bit of blow ice. If you want to make a trip wire, then you can go into the inventory and search TRI for trip wire, but it will also come up with a string. Because of course, TRI features in the word string as well. And on that note, I think that rounds up. Today's 10 minutes of useless information. You've learnt nothing. Congratulations. Big thank you to Austin McConnell for inspiring this little video. It's been a lot of fun. Now catch you in the next one. See ya. And I've got to say, this may sound ridiculous, but you have no idea how long it took. For me to find all of the useless information. There are your sounds ridiculous, right? But try and think of useless information right now. It's hard. That's like an art to it. Because you don't want it to be totally totally totally totally totally useless. But you also don't want it to be entirely useful. It's difficult."}
