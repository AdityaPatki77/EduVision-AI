    "transcript": "gods multiverses and a bold Guy this is the entire one punch man timeline spanning from over 300 million years ago to now and how it's all been building up towards the final fight of the series saitama versus God before man Ruled the Earth there were dinosaurs but amongst them were some pretty damn powerful ones the terror lizard Clan they were at war with the deep sea Kings and Subterranean Kings to take control of the world however like the fate of our own dinosaurs they were most wiped out by a meteor leaving just one Lone Survivor who was frozen Through Time Ancient King but he was killed by met 300 million years later anyway thanks to tataki however God's touch on Earth was already hinted back as far back as this era as we can see on the mural built for him that prehistoric looking creatures were present suggesting that he had an influence on the planet spanning back way before modern day after Millions upon millions of years of evolution we finally enter a world we're a bit more familiar with but before we can get to S and beating up the bad guys am my mask explained that the world's been going through many eras of evolution in the past people fought against each other for land until the population decreased to the point where they prioritized helping future Generations leading to the first era of change but due to the aftermath of all the wars the world itself suffered from climate change causing a rise in sea level erosion and environmental toxicity this resulted in the second era of change forcing the population to migrate to a single land mass which is the one we see in the story this also caused Dr genus to create his Evolution Theory 55 years ago aged just 15 as he believed Humanity had to grow quicker and stronger with the power of science bringing us to the current third era of change one where monsters became more dangerous and more frequent thanks to scammer attracting God to their Dimension this is when genus created the house of evolution and began to learn about God and the limits he had bestowed upon Humanity making it his mission to find a way to break them meanwhile the Hero World began taking shape with characters like bang and bomb being in their Prime while Dr Buoy and kuso studied robotics tatsumaki was also held captive at the Suki facility after being sold off by her parents due to being experimented on due to her powerful esper abilities but she is saved by blast who just so happened to free her whilst on a quest to retrieve a cube containing the power of God moving forward a few more years and sa is born his impact on the planet was almost instantaneous whether he knew it or not as sometime after saitama's birth boros was told of a prophecy that he would find a worthy opponent on Earth thus he began his journey to indulge in a battle that he could enjoy against a powerful being furthermore the superfight tournament Was Won by martial artist goketsu 11 years before the start of the series however he later lost to monster King Orochi who was recently created by pyos after many failed attempts to create a limitless being leading ketu to consume monster cells and join the monster Association in their infancy this was the first step towards a war that would put the entire universe at risk of sa unleashing his full power but before we get too ahead of ourselves four years prior to the story Jonas's family were killed by The Mad cyborg beginning his revenge filled Journey then one year after that saitama began his career as a hero defeating kraban in doing so he also inspired the creation of the hero Association by Saving its Founder's grandson following this saama set out on his journey of what unbeknownst to him would result in him removing the limit of God placed upon him as his body experienced the point of death over and over again becoming the human that went against God he did this by doing his grueling training regime every day as well as battling monsters all whilst refusing to use the air conditioning to help regulate his body's temperature as it would have been an unnatural outsider CET and relying on such things wouldn't let his body progress on his heroic Journey he'd saved the likes of King from Monsters And even met tatsumaki for the first time calling her a brat it was around this time that her sister Fuki was in school best friends with psychos another talented esper however Fuki was worried about sos' dangerous ideologies and her Growing Power thus she sealed It Away With a Kiss pyos didn't realized this at the time thus she became hungry for more power as she felt that she was falling behind and needed it this led to her messing with none other than God but we'll come back to that in just a little bit with the hero Association being formed Blast 2 became a prominent figure as he set out on his mission to learn more about who God is encountering him in person for the first time whil battling against elder ctipe god was watching over Earth in search of a suitable vessel that he could use however he wouldn't have to wait too much longer as G was then expelled from bangs dojo for his violent Behavior kickstarting his journey to becoming absolute evil evil and the world's first God level threat but before him came homeless Emperor the first known victim of God's manipulation bringing us to episode one where saama was now everyone's favorite caped baly being a hero for fun and meeting Jos it was around here that the house of evolution took an interest in saama however Dr genus shut down his experiments of creating a limitless being after realizing that saama had already achieved such a feat naturally a few days later saitama and jenos take the hero exam with the latter being made S rank but saitama only getting C rank despite this he destroys a meteor that threatens Z city after both S-Class Heroes genos and Metal Knight fail to stop it disaster would soon strike again though with the deep sea Kings making their return from deep underwater after all these hundreds of millions of years both he and his seafolk race though were made extinct with saitama killing the King going up to bclass afterwards I tell you what I would not like to live on this Earth because just Days Later shababa predicts the end of the world she could do this using the third eye an ability psychos had also researched in the past when she was a school girl which allowed them to look into the future it wasn't until we saw her use it though that we learned this future sight power came from God shabaa then dies by choking on a cough Suite but if you know me I don't quite believe that as you'll see later in this video those that use God's powers in ways that he doesn't quite approve of tend to get killed by him and I think this is one of those cases regardless the hero Association immediately begins preparations to somehow deal with this end of the world prophecy ow and a Sit also gets a new rank around about now to reach bclass 63 anyway at least the end of the world isn't until a while away right we can at least rest for a bit until then yeah oh no of course silly me just a couple days later is an Alien Invasion from none other than boros who had finally reached his destination of where his prophesized opponent resided sight Hammer the Caped Baldi proved to be too much for him though and boros is killed however notice how in the background we see the moon that's right God who is sealed up there is watching everything there's a big problem with this though and that is unlike God 99.5% of you watching are not subscribed to my channel what the hell guys please ding that notification Bell anyway the destruction of a city by boris's Dark Matter thieves meant that Metal Knight could rebuild it and turn it into a practically indestructible Fortress sometime later saitam befriends King and G begins his hero hunt defeating many Heroes along the way however he soon bumped into saitam who had signed up for the superfight tournament and was one- shot elsewhere powerful monsters continue to attack including Elder centipede who kidnapped waganma the son of a higher ranking executive and sponsor of the hero Association ninki Metal Knight attempted to follow the monster but seemingly to no avail moving on though it was time for the superfight tournament but things turned sour when the first ever winner goketsu who was now a monster Association executive arrived to try and recruit strong Fighters however saitama who had been disqualified for wearing a disguise and using someone else's name made light work of him across the city more powerful monster Association members attacked recruiting new allies by feeding them monster cells with their main target being go the hero Hunter at this point the monster association's war on the world had begun to take shape causing Heroes such as atomic Samurai and his disciples to search for their base G continues hunting Heroes and finds himself in a tricky situation with Janus bang and bomb forcing the monsters to take action and save him as Elder centipede creates a distraction declaring his wish to get revenge on blast from 2 years prior many Heroes tried to defeat him but ultimately King lur It Away by claiming that blast is waiting for him where it's actually scammer who lands a serious punch killing it all whilst Phoenix man carries go away with all the recent outbreaks of monsters and of course the growing issue of go the hero Association begin preparations to end this war despite this ninki fed up with the perceived lack of urgency to save his son sends his own personal unit to find and retrieve him but are easily defeated and captured ultimately turn into Do's slaves for battle as the hero Hunter wakes up underground he's ordered by monster King Orochi to bring him the head of a hero to prove his loyalty as a monster with royal Ripper and Bug God sent to watch over him however G's got no interest in playing along with their games as he wants to strike fear into others without resorting to murder as he believes that should be what a monster is he sees a young boy called tiio which he had recently grown close to getting bullied as he steps into help them following his own childhood trauma of being bullied too go saves the kid but is once again knocked out by scammer and later loses to Royal Ripper and Bug God who sense that he's not cut out to be a monster like they are but during this battle aaro's body conquers death on multiple occasions leading him to start the process of breaking his limiter his loss finds both him and tiio taken back to the monster Association headquarters as tiio is being transported to the cell where wagma is being kept he meets G 5 who just so happened to be carrying the helmet of metal Knight's battles suit following the hero's unsuccessful mission to track Elder centipede however the heroes did have some luck in that regard as they used a small drone to retrace the monster's movements back to its base not going to lie though just look at the size of this thing surely it doesn't take a genius to notice a huge hole in the ground and the tracks that it left behind right I could have told you that it's here though that we're introduced to the monster association's most danger dangerous threats threats so powerful they're said to be like pieces of art made by God himself the cadr go then wakes up as he recalls what happened wandering through the monster Association alerting the leader Goro Goro AKA psychos that he's still alive he bumps into Royal Ripper on his expedition who is about to torture tario saving the young boy in the process as he destroys the monster effortlessly displaying his Newfound growth in strength as he tries to get out of there G bups into more monsters making light work of them but things soon become more difficult as he's approached by overgrown Rover firing a blast of energy his way go barely avoided it but the attack had caused a large earthquake alerting the attention of saitama triio makes a run for it leaving go to face the dragon level threat alone only to find out that the true strength of the monster Association is much more than anything he could have possibly imagined he takes a Point Blank Range attack and and accepts his inevitable death however this was just another instance of his body overcoming such a thing as he was blasted through multiple stories surviving the impact of it all falling through so many flaws go found himself in the face of their leader Goro Goro once again she notices Go's Limitless potential and claims that she can raise him to become the most powerful monster however he began to break through her psychic restriction using his immense ability to adapt to those around him in this case he used metab bat's fighting Spirit to overcome her telekinesis go then attempts to kill her there and then to stop the monster's Rampage but is swiftly brought to a stop as king Orochi is called forth as their fight Ines saitama begins to investigate what on Earth all the noises happening under his apartment elsewhere the hero Association launched their assault on the base but due to trust issues they leave Jos bomb bang and Fuki off the team however King using his own assigned route to decide to bring them with him the true reason for this was so that he had protection but it also allowed bang to come and try and knock some sense into his student and so with the first wave of attacks over with the main Act of this war was ready to take shape flashy flash found himself facing off against former members of the Ninja village where he was once raised who had since become disaster level dragon monsters he made like work of them both but in the process of all the collapsing Rubble around him he lost the transmitter that child Emperor had given to all the heroes on the mission talking of which he had located the remains of metal Knight's robot who had been dismantled and learned the location of waganma after a quick confrontation with Phoenix Man Child Emperor successfully rescued the young boy but was then met by none other than G5 he managed to escape but his luck just continued to get worse as he was met once again by Phoenix man who this time had resurrected from death reaching a new level of power much like aaro and sidama had done before him in an attempt to fight against this reincarnated bird child Emperor used his Brave giant mexit their battle ensues with them eventually bumping into scammer where they managed to defeat the monster alongside the two evil ninjas that thought flashy flashy would come back to life talking of coming back to life elsewhere after 200 deaths in 30 minutes zombie man finally defeats pure blood the vampire and 30 more monsters or whilst a my mask beats dos and saves the enslaved humans many more powerful Heroes engage in combat with dangerous monsters while saitama child Emperor and wagma make their way back to the surface those up top are confused by scammer's presence and Order him to evacuate immediately he claims that's exactly what he's going to do but instead he uses an old monster hole to go straight back down to the base meanwhile Atomic Samurai finds Cario being chased by black s and contacts child Emperor about a second hostage situation and so he heads back into hell zombie man engages in battle with homeless Emperor who reveals how he got his powers after being blessed by God one day in the past moments before he was ready to take his own life things would go from bad to worse from here as Not only was Atomic Samurai facing the worst kind of enemy for a hero like him evil natural water had been set loose a near indestructible monster with a body of nothing but H2 oh two little googly eyes elsewhere Sama encounters Rover and hits him with a punch causing shock waves to reverberate throughout the base and the nearby surroundings to be annihilated the damage was so vast that even jenos who was waiting for S at home noticed it nian witnessing the caves Baldi strength thought it would be an ample time to try and hit him with the sneak attack however as soon as his claws proved to be useless he ran away stricken with fear about sait's true power Goro Goro wonders what on Earth all the noise was and grows concerned at the thought that Rover may have actually been defeated but they have no time to think too hard about it as the tornado of Terror makes her appearance as tatsumaki makes light work of Yodo Yodo realizing that it was nothing more than cyclus his meat puppet in a desperate attempt to defeat tatsumaki yojo calls forth King Orochi however on his way to save his creator however on his way to save his creator the monster bumps into saitam whose Pres alone alerts Orochi that he's not just any ordinary human and instead takes priority over saving yo Yodo he realized that side Hammer was the legendary Ghost Town horror after noticing that even Rover had run away in fear of Sait thus every monster cell in orochi's body told him that Sait was a perfect sacrifice for his complete Resurrection however unbeknownst to him there is no Resurrection for Orochi you see some time ago Ro he stumbled upon an ancient mural deep underground that depicted him at the very top speaking upon his resurrection as God what he didn't know though was that he wasn't looking at the full picture after a short battle with saitam Orochi Was Defeated causing the walls around him to collapse in on themselves revealing that he was nothing more than a porn in the resurrection of the true God back with Goro who was using a tiny flying eye to locate Orochi realizes that he was defeated before the eye is Washed by side Hammer anyway however she mistakenly believes that King is the one responsible for all of it elsewhere though he accidentally finds himself defeating a monster disguised as with ganma by stating that he has no hope in following him as it would only lead to despair what king meant by this was that he's actually too weak to save the child so there was no point really following him however his immense lock ability kicks in as the King Engine activates causing the monster to believe that he meant following him would end in its immediate death and so it as aan iic attack and dice leaving King to desperately seek outside hammer for safety Fuki battles against the Dos who is once again defeated and forced into leading Them To Go's location however she tricks the heroes and summons Rover with a dog whistle who causes complete destruction inside the base flashy flash begins to sense Sy approaching mistaking him for a monster and attacks at top speed y the Caped Baldi just effortlessly Dodges any advances he makes understanding that scammer is just quite Simply Built different the two team together and continue to explore the base as flashy flash brings Cammer up to speed about what is going on the pair get lost in the mazike structure of the base leading Sama to just punch his way through where they encounter a weak monster named Monaco forcing it to show them the way to her boss this small monster was actually a fragment of Goro Goro that had been separated inside its incubator on accident which then gained sentience meanwhile at G's real location puy puy prisoner stumbles upon it where the hero Hunter is sleep sleeping tied up in his chains however go soon snaps free and easily defeats the hero where he then bumps into dark shine whilst he does a little bit better his fate is ultimately the same as G then wakes up mid battle putting a swift stop to their braw displaying the frightening increase of strength he achieved with his limit to continuing to break back on the surface Nan who would now quit the monster Association after seeing s attacks the weaker Heroes protecting W gunma he soon finds himself in a pretty tricky situation though when the Class Hero Drive Knight appears to save the day he reveals That Metal Knight is in fact a traitor and had his robots caught on purpose so that the monster Association could analyze it for information and weaken the heroes or part of a long elaborate scheme to eventually take over the world with his own military power suddenly G5 appears and attacks the weakened Heroes but they are saved just in the nick of time this time by Jos who entered the battle after hearing the noise caused by saitam with his help the injured are quickly evacuated including WMA who is now safe inside of the extraction Convoy meaning Jos can finally join up inside of the base and team up with the rest of the S-Class Heroes at this point though the monster association's most powerful members the cadr had encountered Heroes and displayed their frightening power putting them in an extremely advantageous position to win this war thus for the first time in a long long while the S-Class felt fear there was hope though and it was in the form of t saki pyos kept herself hidden deep away underground so that no other Association member even knew it existed this way she could sit back and relax whilst the war took place using Meat Puppets to give orders all whilst avoiding tatsumaki hypothetically it was the safest place on Earth or so she thought quite unbelievably tatsumaki sensed sos' location immediately by intercepting her psychic signal this meant that she could forcefully bind pyos and bring her up to tatsumaki's location the Panic swiftly begins to set SLE in as pyos calls for Rover's help however just like with a roochi before no luck Rover had been beaten and subsequently tamed by Fuki bomb and Bank things just continued to go from bad to worse for cyos is she realized that saam and flashy flash were also closing in on the inner sanctum with no choice but to reveal herself and fight pyos drank an Elixir which boosts her psychic power as tatsumaki drags her up through the ground as their battle begins elsewhere King finds tario but believes him to be a shape-shifting monster just like the last child he met was thus he menacingly declares that the monster is Despicable for disguising its true form in favor of a sneak attack what king didn't realize however was that a completely transparent monster was stood behind tario the entire time causing it to flee in fear of King's immense skill to notice its presence the poor monster doesn't get too far however as aoi's heart soon ate it in an attempt to regenerate his body and return to his former glory as the monster King and so after a quick little m bang arochi makes his way up to pyos and forcefully fuses with her corrupting her mind with his power and so saoi is born with a newfound level of power saoi turned the tide against tatsumaki by switching the inside with the outside of her barrier this meant that she couldn't disable it and had to enoy the strength of not just her own power putting pressure on herself but the ever increasing amount of cochis however tatsumaki got a lucky break as elsewhere in the association base saitama destroyed some roi's cells causing pain to the main body more good news soon came when tatsumaki got word from King that he was with the second hostage this meant that the tornado of Terror no longer had to hold back she began protecting her allies by encasing everyone inside a psychic barrier airlifting them to safety from the collapsing base this cut short the battle between go and darkshine who was reminded of his childhood trauma with all her teammates now safe she could start to have some fun this began with her using her power to trap cochi inside a Fortress crafted from a large chunk of Z City she had no look though as cochi simply Broke Free you see in the merging process cyos got a lot larger however her size wasn't the only thing that had grown either as two did her power with saoi letting out a large blast visible from space everybody was confused at where this incredible power had just suddenly come from but things soon made sense as she revealed that God had visited saos during the final moments of her merge with a roachie he prayed upon her weak mental state and turned her into his porn where in return pyos would be blessed with the crazy amounts of power we see during the onslaught tatsumaki ensured that King had escaped with the final hostage meanwhile the tornado of Terror prevented a countrysize tsunami from striking the battle between these two amazing espers caused of the scenery around them to make those watching wonder if this was the end of the world suddenly tatsumaki vanished and much to sai's surprise popped up inside her own breast I am pretty certain that marata just drew this with one hand nonetheless tatsumaki then went on to twist her up from the inside with Victory seemingly assured however her opponent lived and swiftly stabbed tatsumaki overloading her with psychic energy badly injuring her in the process in spite of this she was saved by none other than Jos giving tatsumaki just enough time to finish saving everyone below her with that done she could turn all of her attention to the foe in front of her th the tornado of Terror began manipulating the entirety of Z City twisting it up until sroi was moments from Death however in the distance was God upon the moon watching over the battle which is when suddenly tatsumaki began overexerting herself coughing up blood allowing cochi to make an escape the S-Class hero wasn't going to let her get away with this and so she Unleashed a large scale barrier to keep her in close range whilst the monster believed they had succeeded in killing tataki it turned out to be none other than a decoy things finally began to look up for the heroes once more as Drive Knight entered the freight engaging in a large scale dog fight aided by other powerful Heroes after a long hardfought battle aroi and pyos are separated somehow still conscious tataki digs up a large spear spanning for miles to finally kill the monster King with on the other hand s Hammer flashy flash of Monaco had been trapped underneath all the rubble looking for Flash's sword in doing so the three of them come across an extremely rare artifact one of God's transmitter cubes as they stare into the large hole created by tatsumaki they are met with nothingness just complete darkness however what was truly on the other side was God's Dimension who could now communicate with the trio that had touched the cube you see they had been warped there upon discovering the cube as God tries to lure them in into accepting his manipulative deal for power in his desperate search for an avatar they are saved by blast the number one S-Class hero explains the purpose of the cube they had found and how dangerous it truly was quickly teleporting them back to their own Dimension where the battle with tatsumaki continues she fires her large spear deep underground into the monster Association headquarters narrowly missing scammer as she senses a dimensional shift caused by blast's appearance the hero's victory was shortlived however as the cadr began their terrifying Onslaught decimating those unlucky enough to get in their way elsewhere Jos begins to feel the results of his battle with saoi as he's exceeded his limits and his moments from self-destructing however Fuki stands up to save him using her telekinesis to suppress the thermal notion and cool him down she succeeds but in turn is vastly weakened from using too much of her own power she tries to stop her sister from heading back out into battle worried that she would die however it's no use tsumiki continues to help her allies against the cadr only to find herself in trouble yet again against fur or ugly thank y Jos and bang come to her rescue this causes the two monsters few ugly and gums to fight each other resulting in the death of the latter as ugly emerges from within the monster's body taking on a brand new form after having its body dissolved by stomach acid as the tatsumaki rescue squad make their retreat they are chased by a swarm of black spur forcing tatsumaki to use the very little amount of power that she had left to restrain them elsewhere though the other heroes are not so lucky black sperm continues to split until it becomes a sea of heiny monsters causing Havoc across the battlefield furthermore homeless Emperor watches on in Glee as he states that all is how the heavens will it to be adding further subtle foreshadowing that God has been manipulating the events on Earth for a very long time as we see the moon in the distance things take a turn for the worst next as G enters the battlefield whilst his appearance is unrecognizable with his monstrous new form however his murderous intent is unmistakable able the two brothers bang and bom immediately engaged in a fierce battle with G with each fist that connected Bang's words for his student got through he declared how he would save go and once he did he vowed to retire as a hero and focus on being master and disciple once again such a promise caused Go's monsterification to begin cracking nonetheless their battle went on until go landed a slight graze on bang which was enough to defeat him elsewhere the new and improved fura ugly goes on a killing spr killing two members of the Council of Swordsmen and badly injuring the leader nitri who passes down the legendary Sun blade to Atomic Samurai fural ugly then finds himself on the other hand of a powerful punch from the newly formed Golden Spur this was the result of multiple black sperm cells merging together to increase their power jenos begins to drag tatsumaki's limp body across the ground with his mouth after the two were overpowered by an army of black sperm cells as a loud heartbeat could be heard in the distance this didn't stop the small army of monsters tearing jennus apart limb by limo and so everything looked hopeless for him but then King arrived knowing that the hero association's strongest fighter stood before them all of the remaining CAD prepared for the fight of their lives this included homeless Emperor golden sperm who had just suffered a severed arm from Atomic Samurai's powerful sunblade and the newly emerged evil natural water oh and let's not forget the thousands upon thousands of smaller sperm cells what is one PCH man anyway homeless Emperor makes the first move declaring that he will test how the strongest would Dodge his attack however the unexpected occurs King politely points out that the ground beneath homeless Emperor was uneven and dangerous such an observation frightens the dragon level threat as he believes King is so much stronger than him that he is actually the one being tested as homeless Emperor begins to panic he's ambushed by zombie man he begs for the aid of other Cadre but is met with silence as the other s are Frozen with caution by King's presence child Emperor explains that all they have to do now is attack the Cadre from both sides to line them up for King to unleash his final killer move that was their only win condition realizing the danger they're in a total of 54 trillion sperm cells combined to create Platinum sperm oh this is actually a really serious moment as this is happening zombie man confronts homeless Emperor about the legitimacy of his story about God and demands he tell him everything but before the Cadre could even have time to Spill the Beans he sees a monstrous figure appear in the distance scaling the Moon it was God he took back the power he gifted homeless Emperor and in doing so stripped him of his life causing his body to melt away his final words were calling out to God causing zombie men to begin wondering if he really does exist after all furo ugly stumbles upon bangs beaten up body and goes in for the kill however the hero's words of encouragement begin to resonate with g once more who speed blitzes the monster before he can kill his former sensor with an overwhelming sense of emotion overcoming him G rushes into the midst of battle as king finally resorts to using his ultimate Purgatory Hellfire burst wave Cannon G rushes towards Platinum sperm and takes out the fusion with one punch evil natural water is also unlucky enough to find himself on the end of a brutal Beatdown with all of this happening in less than a single second the heroes watching un mistake King to be the one responsible for saving them from the cadr suddenly a portal opens a sight am a flashy flash of Monaco comes stumbling out much to King's relief go Stars down saam as the Caped Baldi swiftly rushes past him seeing how badly beat up Jos is learning of his students sacrificial actions to protect tatsumaki saitama congratulates jenos for growing stronger in his heart Flash flash joins the fight but to no avail suddenly Platinum sperm returns causing damage to both go and the S-Class hero the three begin a large scale fight it speeds so fast it creates a geometric structure visible in the sky above the city the hero Hunter then begins to master his own ultimate martial arts technique which he dubs the monster Calamity God Slayer fist stating that something as unreliable as God would be crushed by his hands yeah I'm sure that Adel meanwhile deep in the ground where God's mural was buried a new giant centipede monster called sage centipede emerges whilst evil natural water morphs with the ocean becoming the fittingly named evil ocean water as G bursts through Platinum sperm at high speeds he explodes and sends tiny particles of light glistening in the sky as suddenly blast appears before tatsumaki as she opens her eyes blast tells her that he can give her his power these words quickly resonate with her as she thinks back to what blast said the day he saved her when the time comes don't go expecting someone to save you the man standing before her turned out to be none other than God who after watching her battle with saoi tried to make her his new Avatar but with his cover blown he Resorts back to the drawing board with the real blast quickly appearing proud of how strong tatsumaki had become to resist God's manipulation he entrusts her to King's care as he head backs to where he came from to provide backup to his Guardians of the Galaxy Pals to help defeat God Sage centipede then erupts from underground declaring that he and evil ocean water have been sent to defeat the one known as the fist that went against God AKA saam who just so happens to show up and onot evil ocean water with a single serious punch this causes a huge disruption in the sea as he splits it in half forcing saitam to serve to safety using a large carrier vessel G tells the helicopter housing tario to get the hell out of here throwing them 500 M away into a safety net as he then teams up with metal bat to take down Sage centipede go draws it high up into the sky where he then karate chops the entire monster in half killing it instantly elsewhere a my mask tries to kill Monaco who is attempting to resuscitate flashy flash following his battle with Platinum sperm and goo however the monster is saved by sight Hammer Surfing by on his ship the new blizzard group then appears with me looking incredibly respectfully if I may add meanwhile saitama Parks up his boat and heads out into battle against go with most of the S-Class Heroes defeated go was all but finished on his journey to become absolute evil yet there was still one thing bothering him he just couldn't quite put his finger on it yet as saitama stood before him complaining about how his day had been terrible and how right now he would have no problem just obliterating the entire planet due to his bad mood the pressure alone emitting from saitama shook go however saitam had no interest in fighting if it wasn't against a monster angered go goes in for an attack upon feeling the power of saitama's fist though he finally realizes who it is he's facing up against it's here that go understood that in order to become absolute evil he had to defeat scammer thus their insane battle ensues as they launch and attack at each other at break neck speed G attempts a full strength karate chop but the impact simply just shatters his own arm the rage he felt contributed to Go's body undergoing a more severe monsterification however tario who had found his way back to the battlefield was there to witness this transformation with the little boy telling go that in reality he is a hero anytime he was in danger it would always be go that saved him he tried talking sense into him but go was too stubborn to listen to the young boy's logic as he was committed to ruling the world with Terror saitama then teases the hero Hunter launching him into the distance so that they can continue their battle in safety however before doing so the cave Baldi reassures Terio that he will simply stop goo and not kill him this is because deep down saitama knows that g wants to do things for the right reasons he wants to be a hero thus he teases him about it Go attacks sending scammer flying through building blocks destroying them in the process however it just further backed up saam's claim of G doing good as he accidentally freed a group of office workers trapped underground G's monsterification continued along with his anger as the hero Hunter then sprouted some wings with his new found strength he destroyed half a volcano but once again this just inadvertedly saved more lives he grew more arms and struck saitam into the ground with all his might once again saving the day as he stopped a Plane full of people from drowning however the battle between these two Limitless beings started to have a negative effect after all in another dimension blast and his Guardians of the Galaxy crew noticed that the Earth's magnetic and gravitational fields were going crazy causing a spatial Distortion to form a hole inside of the dimensional seal holding God this allowed him to break through even if just partially and so as saitam seemingly defeated goo when his mentality was at his weakest God appeared to pray upon him he disguised himself as bang and offered the hero Hunter power to complete his goal however much like tatsumaki go refused in spite of this he still ever so briefly touched the hand of God becoming his new Avatar thus Cosmic G was born becoming the world's first God level threat with this new form came the knowledge of the flow of all energy and the behavior of all forces Across the Universe with just a single punch go cre created a nuclear explosion as pyos watched on from the distance she immediately recognized that this was the divine power granted only by God using his talent to instantly copy his opponent go entered Sait mode and Unleashed a flurry of consecutive normal punches the two were equal however G wanted to prove to the world that he was absolute evil thus he let loose a whole ass Gamay burst suddenly all the heroes were frozen with fear as the Monstrous Cosmic fear go stood before them as they fell to the ground suffering from the cosmic radiation poisoning bang tried one final time to talk some sense into his students believing that he must have been being controlled and that this isn't something G would normally do though the hero Hunter says that that isn't true blast shows up once more confirming Bang's hypothesis revealing that God is controlling him and that with each attack go produces the entire planet is is at risk of being wiped out in spite of this go just continues his pursuit to become the symbol of fear which is when jenos flies in with a headbutt it does nothing causing blast to launch an attack of his own he's believed to have trapped a g within a portal however the hero Hunter had already copied blast technique and escaped by creating his own realizing that he needed more power to achieve his goal he conducts a plan to force Sama into going all out that way go would be able to copy and refine the C baldi's full strength thus he picks Janos up and pierces him straight through the heart repping out his core killing him instantly saitam who had shown up just a fraction too late as he was still recovering from being hit with the Gamay burst stood there in disbelief witnessing his best friend's lifeless body go threw Genesis court at him which is when saitama snapped he Unleashed a serious punch which G copied resulting in serious punch squared and an attack that would have for sure destroyed the Earth had it not been for blast teleporting them both to space the subsequent explosion caused by their Clash of fists send them flying to the surface of one of Jupiter's moons IO leaving behind a huge gap in the Galaxy meanwhile the spine of God could be witnessed trapped within the moon watching everything unfold before his very eyes whilst go tried showing off his immense power saitama just ripped up the entire surface of the Moon annihilated in it with just one hand as the hero Hunter loses all sense of direction saitam unleashes an omnidirectional serious punch from all angles that was the moment that g realized fighting such an opponent was unfair he finally got a taste of an opponent that was limitlessly strong even scammer had now begun copying Go's martial arts moves instantaneously suddenly Go's life was in serious danger as with each attack scammer continued to grow more and more until he reached a point where there was no longer anybody left in existence that could measure the level of strength that he had reached this was made all the more clear when with just a single sneeze saitama removed Jupiter's entire gaseous layer leaving behind just its core once Garo is simply stunned at the monster that side D had become he has one trick left up his sleeve as he teleports the no longer caped baly to the surface of the Sun nonetheless with just a simple fart SA caught back up to go with the two plummeting back to Earth the final punch had broken through the monsterification and brought go back to his senses as he saw triio lying there lifeless due to his own doing he realized what he had done wrong the one person that he wanted to save was now the one that he had killed thus go instructed saama to copy his next moves as if there was anyone that could replicate the power of God without his help it would be him talking of God he caught wind of what go was trying to do thus began strapping him of his power much like he did homeless Emperor turning the hero Hunter's body to Salt this time in the process until he ceased to exist however he was too late saama had done it through what can only be described as I'm not even sure that makes sense to be honest science saitama began traveling back in time by doing some particle Shenanigans I don't know if I'm honest as he saw small Windows of the past unfold before him saitama jumped back to when go first entered his Cosmic fear mode defeating him with a single punch suddenly the naked time traveling scammer and the scammer of the past merged together as one to stop any breaches in the multiversal timeline as a result of this saama forgot everything and the credit of defeating go was passed onto blast however he still had the core of the Dead genos thus when the new genos plugged himself into it he was met with the flood of information that had had happened in the alternate timeline confirming the multiversal hypothesis indeed existed elsewhere the voice of the alternate past go could be heard telling triio to stand up what he saw before him was then a faint image of go smiling knowing that the young boy was safe before crumbling into nothingness whilst tario just rubbed his eyes believing that it must have been a dream he hears voices in the distance as this timeline G faces a great beat down by the heroes Sur round metal bat calls for them all to stop however am my Mas believes that go deserves to be executed as they would do any other monster however before he could do such a thing Taro appears to stop them at the same time the King Engine begins making everyone [ __ ] themselves thus Bang King and scammer give go a second chance as he quickly escapes the battlefield to safety miraculously Metal Knight then appears after detecting the nuclear blast caused by G thus he begins decontamination procedures for every everyone infected with the radiation poisoning elsewhere saama tells jennus that they need to get him to Dr cusino to fix up his arms and legs that way they can begin searching for what's left of their apartment of course though the threat of God Still Remains as Sean Fuki PS up an unconscious Cycles from the rubble peering into her mind what she saw was the source of her Madness what she saw was God now when the time comes I'll be sure to make a part two so be sure to ding that notification Bell and leave a like because you won't want to miss out in the meantime though you could probably click on this video right [Music] here"
