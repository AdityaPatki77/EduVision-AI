    "transcript": "hey yo what's up everybody now that we're gearing up towards weathering waves patch 2.0 I thought it'd be a nice idea to recap what actually happened and what we know from the story from all the 1.x patches you might find some things you didn't notice your first time around I know I did reviewing everything by the way I'll try as much as possible to go in chronological order but there will be times where it just makes sense to go in the order they present things in the story and just so you know I won't be including everything but I will be including the most important point in story beat also this is by far my longest video and it took me quite a long time to make so if you really rock with this type of content please let me know by liking and sharing this video without further Ado let's get it let's start at the beginning third planet from the Sun the world of solar 3 has been the subject of strange catastrophes known as the lament for over 10 th000 years is destroying the world as Humanity knows it the first great lament changed everything in terms of the physics of the world everything except gravity it's the only natural law that remained intact but one of the major changes the lament made to the world was it caused everything in the world to be converted to vibrating frequencies or reverberations when people resonate with the frequencies of other things and can manipulate them they are called resonators a key characteristic of resonators is their tcid mark it denotes their resonator status of course we play as the Rover so who is the Rover how do they fit into all of this well there's a lot we don't know but we do know more than you might think it's not clear how old the Rover is but we do know the Rover has been battling the lament for a long time basically since it started so like for Millennia the lament causes all kinds of crazy phenomena in Solaris 3 phenomena like tcid fields where monsters known as tacd discords come out of or strange [ __ ] likee ore called tacti and a whole lot more well one day while on an island entirely made of tasti R discovers an ancient machine that can predict lament outbreaks the machine is the teth system figuring that such a device could greatly Aid in the fight against the lament Rover founded an organization for battling the lament on that very Island that place would become known as the black Shores teleport points we use serve as beacons that relay information to teus to monitor the lament all across the globe in these days the Rover was also known as the astral modulator he was one who oversaw the data collected by tethis and S to te's proper functioning speaking of which the teus system's core was malfunctioning what is te's core well te being a machine incapable of emotion the te core requires strong emotions to function just like the Lament The lament feeds on human emotion so they thought it was a win-win to use the lament for the purpose of being te's core so go ahead and drop that thing inside of teth a lament inside of teus would theoretically allow them to study it and feed teus the energy it requires to function however eventually it proved to be unstable who would have thought right basically what was happening was the lament inside of teus would reanimate the copies of people who died during the limit outbreak replaying that day over and over and over again without end anyways they needed a new core for teus so the shke keeper was created for the purpose of stabilizing the teus core she was to be a being born of pight energy and oh yeah the important part she was able to experience emotion so go ahead and drop that thing inside of tus but it's not that simple without emotion came sentience Rover and the shke keeper became quite fond of each other he taught her to play the piano had deep conversations with her took her to different nations like Reena and created vibrant memories I mean they spent a long time together they've known each other for essentially Millennia at this point he even went on to create Jet and found Jing Joo during this stretch of time so when it came down to dropping her inside the te's core he couldn't do it that would mean losing all of that forever so rather than let that happen the Rover left the black Shores to find another way that was 20 years ago somewhere between then and now the Rover lost all of their memories at the start of the game we can see the rover and a mysterious goddess before him before activating his tasset Mark she appears to reach inside of his chest and place something there could this be Abby we don't know while this scene is at the start of the game it isn't clear when it actually happens as we know the Rover was a resonator C in reverberations of tcid discords way before the start of the game this frequency has dwelled within you for millions of years in fact this isn't even his first time being reawakened so why would they just be receiving a tcid Mark here does this happen every time they reawaken there are a few theories about this but I won't get too deep into theories in this video so I'll just State the facts for now so the goddess plunges robber into a portal a portal Landing us into the e sea the aetheric sea typically emerges when a tacit field is about to form and we will soon discover a newly formed tacit field on the ground not far from where we woke up many people stand to benefit from taking advantage of a powerful figure with no memory of its past information about who you are and your arrival was known and anticipated by a select few among the known factions aware of the Rover's condition are the fraus black Shores Sentinel J Chang Lee and Jin XI the magistrate of Jin Joe a Party of Three was organized to retrieve you after you appear in Jing Joe that party consists of Jin Joo junor patroller chisha yangyang of the midnight Rangers outrider Division and by XI A Healer and researcher of theu Academy it's likely you were first discovered by B who later goes off on her own to investigate the newly formed tcii you awaken in The Gorge of spirits to find yangyang and chisha there to greet you yangyang remarks that it looks like drowning in reference to your condition they all decide to team up together and head to their meeting spot to catch up with by G along the way you come to an area with a huge giant dragon statue and of course we know that dragon is J the r has a flashback seeing himself face to face with JY which is quite fitting because it was here a Century prior that the Rover harnessing the power of Jer defeated the crownless and established Gan Joe after the flashback yyang tells us more about Jet and about the Sentinels in general it's from her that we learned that there are six cities in one capital of Wong long the Sentinels are present wherever civilization thrives and each major city has its own Sentinel to watch over and protect the people we also learned that originally all the Sentinels of Wang long were once one entity but for some unknown reason they split into six and became responsible for their own respective areas of hang L yangyang tells us that only a sentinel's appointed resonator is allowed within its proximity which brings into question who or what will be the resonator of raguna Sentinel in Rena anyways we finally arrive at the meeting spot we discover B isn't there she is instead investigating a tcid field nearby and what spawns from this tcid field the crownless he's back with a vengeance or or not we kind of beat him with a lot less effort than was seemingly required a century ago after defeating the crownless its reverberation AKA its Echo is left behind our friends ask us to use our terminal to collect it but my man's terminal is at level zero y'all suddenly we hear aby's voice saying it's hungry and it collects the echo for us after collecting it we have another quick flashback of the dreamless because news flash guys battling the theodon is something we've already done too our new buddies are pretty surprised to see us just scoop up that Echo without a terminal well I mean b is chill as usual but chisha is wilding out and yangyang drops a massive lore bomb this is like what the first 10 minutes of gameplay and she references this book called The comprehensive mirror for historians she mentions that the person described in the book The Rover is essentially a Celestial being who commanded the power of the universe this being took up Mortal form and created pangu basically the ability to capture Echoes everybody else needs a pangu terminal and this man just Scoops him up with his bare hands or aby's hand you know what I'm talking about chisha goes on to say that this person used the first Echo to rebuild the world sort out the laws and establish twang long right after this the aetheric sea dissipates and our friends receive a message from magistrate Jin she she says that she's been waiting for us which isn't much of a surprise given what we now know Sentinel J prophesied your return and Jin shei have been sharing information about you with black Shores together with Chang Lee She devised a method of operation it's unclear on how much information was shared between the various parties though because uh black Shores was kind of moving like they were on the other side of the fence you know what I mean they had villain energy we head out to meet J she and Camila is in the tree just staring at us muttering to herself sounding all devious as she does we finally make it to City all jingi isn't there instead we meet with her bodyguard San who sees the world differently than other people basically she's blind but she can see the world in frequencies what's notable is that the Rover is one of the few people she actually sees as they are from her backstory we learned that she usually sees everyone as Twisted monsters which goes back to one of my theories but again a video for another day son gives us three objects Jin she left as Clues they serve as a way for her to meet us without prying eyes and ears of ill-intentioned people getting information they aren't supposed to know such as the current state of J to see if we can gain some insight on these objects we head to theu Academy coincidentally we also agreed earlier to have our resonator status evaluated by the academy while doing so baij speculates that there must be some kind of Dimension or creature existing in our body a creature capable of absorbing frequencies we now know this creature to be Abby during this examination baji has us do a combat simulation in a sonaro sphere the sonaro causes visions of a giant moon and the dreamless after leaving the simulation we tell baiji what we saw and she says that it reminds her of an ancient war adding further Credence to the notion that the Rover has experienced combat against these beings before by morte and yangyang go on to provide more information about the clues helping to Solve the Riddle of gingi's three objects after leaving the Wu Academy it's revealed that we're being watched by yet another faction the fraxus Rover and his friends decided on a course of action to get more info to solve Jin's puzzle on the way they meet John Shen the guards are give giving her a hard time but we vouch for her and it's all good when one of the guards examines our access pass he finds out that we have the highest level of access clearance and the other guard says that with this level of access we can lead an entire Army out of the city and no one would question it just one of the perks of establishing the country I guess anyway we leave with John Shin and head to a military base to find the person she's looking for we fulfilled a few side missions along the way to give more insight about the intense struggle of the soldiers and life outside of the city while speaking with yangyang you suddenly hear aby's voice again saying food R's Consciousness is transported through the eyes of a tacid Discord he's able to see battle currently taking place in northall Barren which is really interesting because we don't really ever see this happen again as far as I can recall the r recalls what B told him about one of the three objects he deduces that the object's frequency matches with the coordinates of Chi-Chi Village when we get to Chichi Village we find a strange tacit Discord it doesn't attack us it instead repeats the cries of distressed humans who once inhabited The Village yangyang draws the conclusion that the village was destroyed not too long ago and that someone might have intentionally concealed The Village to hide what happened we can sense that someone connected with what happened is still nearby after looking around they notice cards in the ground scars cards and yangyang deduces that the fraxus must be behind this if you don't know who the fraxus is after this video check out this one basically the midnight Rangers and jingi view them as a terrorist organization in short they believe everyone should have resonance abilities but beyond that no one really seems to know their true goal yangyang describes one Frac of his member by saying there's a man who sees no order and Revels in destruction and that she's seen those cards before suddenly boom a huge red portal appears behind yangyang sucking her in it's scar man knows how to make an entrance that's for sure anyway he explains that yangyang is safe and that he just wanted to remove her so she wouldn't sway our judgment he reveals that he's heard that we lost our memory and has been following us since we first woke up and he goes on to say that there are a number of other people who've been following us but out of all of them he's the only one who came forward to meet us face to face with absolute honesty he tells us that forces have been fighting for possession over us from the moment we woke up and every person we've met knows how valuable we are which if you think about it it does kind of recontextualize all the times people kept comparing you to an ancient Celestial being seemingly on a whim anyway scar tells us the fraus didn't destroy the village scar knows that we won't be easily swayed by just explaining things himself and encourage us to look around to find find Clues to let us know what really happened after looking at some Clues we guess that the villagers killed each other and he says that we're right but the truth is far more complicated he tells a story involving a metaphor involving sheep and an evil Shepherd the Rover asks scar is that why he became the shepherd and he responds that he was never the shepherd and never will be he says that he and the robber are the black lamb the situation escalates to a point where scar generates his elesium realm where we face him in combat but mid fight yangyang wakes us up in the real world and tells us she shattered Scar's illusion then fova emerges and tells scar that he took his meeting a bit too far after Scar and fova leave a single tacd Discord is left frantically yelling brother brother Yang and Rover suspect that he's referring to scar R explains what scar told him and yangyang says despite how twisted he is we can't take his words for granted so we go and look for more information then it's revealed that sanwa had been watching them the entire time and over the phone she mentions to Jin shei that just as she anticipated scar did not try to kill or harm Rob and yangyang and confirms that she stayed out of it as asked Rob and yangyang search for more information and this takes them to an underground Cavern it's there that they find an old tattered diary and this diary di details the truth of the village scar had indeed visited the village before he told the girl writing the diary that she could call him brother and he told her the same story of the shepherd and the Sheep just like he told us he said we are the black sheep referring to himself and the girl it isn't exactly clear what other involvement scar had with the village but what he told us was essentially true the girl had the ability to resonate with the frequencies of tacd discords humans granting her the ability to reanimate the dead into tacd discords her sister died trying to protect her and she transformed her into a TD the girl felt super guilty and wanted to find a way to fully return her to human form but questions if it's really possible the other villagers find out about what happened and they are Furious they surround the house calling her and her father murderers the girl prays for salvation for Chi-Chi Village and the last line of text text in her diary is written in another handwriting and it reads it seems you are the luckier One yangyang Believes the T of Discord we saw earlier stay to convey the last wishes of the girl later in the city we discussed in further detail with chisha we learned that the record say the whole event happened a long time ago and that the vast majority of people in the village were relocated chisha yyang and Rover start to speculate that scar might have taken the girl away to safety or maybe to to join the fraus all right y'all I just want to interrupt the recap to say this while this is one of the more fun and interesting parts of the story especially the first time around I got to say it the storytelling here really isn't that good and it's hard to actually tell what's happening yangyang says it looks like this event happened recently but chisha says it happened a long time ago scar says everyone killed each other the diary hints that but leaves the ending open however chesa says most of the people in the village were just relocated scar tells us that the girl was sacrificed yangyang speculates the Tassa Discord is her only to later state that it's just conveying Her Last Wish and at the end chisha yangyang and Rover questioned if scar saved the girl and took her away from the village however the diary implies she might have died there are all kinds of anomalies between Scar yangyang the diary in chisha and they even go back and forth as to what things mean as the story progresses so just know if you're confused here it's not just you it was written that way moving on we solved gin's puzzle and it leads us to the Grand Library access to various Grand libraries across while along are almost never open to the public and are usually only accessible by the Sentinels and their respective magistrates these libraries are huge databases and carry all sorts of information that date back to ancient days before setting off to the Grand Library it's explained that Rover met with Jin shei in secret after solving the last of her three riddles during this meeting it's revealed that she was searching for Sentinel JW she knows the fraxus is behind his disappearance she goes on to tell us what she believes to be the fraus objectives which are to cause another lament persuade us to join their side capture J and Resurrect The rodian she said when J last spoke to her it mentioned about the noon being in northfall baren because she knows scar is trailing us she sets a trap at the Grand Library so as planned Rover heads to the Grand library to fulfill gin's request after making it there we find that part of the library is submerged in water in order to set everything right and reach the database we solve a series of puzzles and reach the core of the database scar reveals himself and threatens us he wants to blow the whole place up but Rover is unsurprised and unfazed by Scar's PR pres because of the plan scar discovers it was all a trap the entire time and decides to peace out but before he can teleport out Rover jumps in his domain expansion to do battle this time scar transforms into a giant beast but he is defeated afterwards he questions how it all happened how were we so prepared and the secret meeting plot is revealed scar is then handcuffed and about to be sent to jail but before he is he says that once we know what we really are will come to the frait US with no hesitation and then he tosses us his card after scar is arrested jingi tells us about the black Shores she says one member contacted her for more information from the moment of our Awakening and that it's thanks to them that our meeting went smoothly Jin she lets us know that the fraxus is still following us and that we should consider connecting with the black Shores because they might be our allies in the future after telling yangyang and chisha about her experience speaking with Jin shei we decided to seek out more information about the black shores of course all the black Shores members wear the Blake Bloom flower so in order to grab the attention of the black Shores we decided to get a Blake Bloon to lure them out this brings about our introduction to Verina she analyzes the image of the Blake Bloom given to us by Jin shei and she makes an artificial version using her resonance abilities when Rover begins to walk away he senses someone is following him at first it seemed to be the fraus but it turns out the fraus wasn't the only fa and following him this time it's here that we are formally introduced to chamelia she lunges a flurry of attacks at us and that results in Rover pinning her down she introduces herself as a black Shores Bloom Bearer a person who seeks out new recruits tests their abilities and trains them teus has instructed her to see goow while chamelia is a part of the black Shores she isn't really dedicated to her Mission as she is to testing her combat prowess she says that she'll be watching us and then she escapes we return to the City and we find Alto and Anor have also been following us chisha spots Alto being sus and interrogates him Anor actually makes him sound more sus So eventually he Batman's out of there with his smoke bomb Forte we track him down and he basically lets us know that he's way more knowledgeable than he appears he explains that he wanted to get us alone he knows we work with a plant type resonator to make the Blake Bloom we have and that they have people that can do that too he tells us that he has information our past but as an information broker it will come at a cost basically you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours he invites us to come with him and Encore to Aid in his mission as compensation his mission is to investigate an abandoned Court of Cante facility because something is wrong with their lament detection system in the area and Alto suspects that the resident Beacon has been damaged after getting inside the facility we learned quite a few things we learned that that the court of savant's research facility was sponsored by a fraus overseer most likely Scar the Court's goal was to recreate the unknown God we see at the start of the game a holographic image of her displays and rer says he thinks he knows her Alo quips knew it the facility's researchers were just a small faction not representative of the whole of the court of savante they were studying an ancient civilization they believed to be divine beings being fascinated with the civilization they tried recreating past events using artificial retro act rain when they failed they tried creating a repca and that resulted in Mech Abomination after helping Alto with his investigation he answers another of questions for us as to the question of why they were in Jing Joo he responds that they sensed that theodon was about to be resurrected and came to inform the magistrate we asked him about our connection to Black Shores to which he says he doesn't really know much about hidden secrets as he's only a consultant however he reveals that this isn't our first time being reawakened and last time we woke up at the black Shores which brings so many questions to mind like how many times has the Rover been reawakened and what said the circumstances result in his dormant state does he forget his past every time or is this just the first time anyways just as the mission was concluding we rush out side to see real retroact rain occurring around us we get an emergency call from yangyang letting us know that ging Joo is under attack and that there's a TD outbreak the reason all this is happening is because frova is controlling Tassa discords and summoning the trodon of War here our perspective is shifted to gon he's out in the front lines in deser rock Highlands the retroact rain causes hallucinations as especially in areas where there's a lot of casualties while the rain just causes hallucinations as the casualties increase the effects of those hallucinations and Phantoms become real even though the antidote for the Retro act rign effects have been distributed some soldiers still report sporadically seeing Phantoms in the rain and gon is of no exception he sees the previous general of the midnight Rangers General guu Lyn this Hallucination is criticizing his leader ship ability hearkening Back to Before Gian was a general and just a medic that day Gian advised General guu Lin to not go into battle because of the Phantoms so the Phantom guu Lin questioned what Gian would do if he was in his shoes that same day Gian eventually finds his resolve and destroys the hallucination then the void plenon appears it's the giant distorted moon in the sky once it completely takes shape over thrax the theodon of War will be reawakened it consumes weapon frequencies to enhance itself after countless battles the northall baren has become a massive graveyard of weapons which would make the trodon even stronger than before eventually this Moon harnesses enough power for the over thra statue to emerge from the sea built from repurposed weapons and debris it forms a barrier around ground itself to continue Gathering energy so we strategize how to attack it while it's still weak together with gon morte and by a strategy is devised to use a machine called the disruptor to destroy the barrier they enact the plan and a huge laser destroys the barrier once inside Rover and Gian make their way to the over thrax statue the theodon reconstitutes the frequencies of the crownless but it's no match for Rover and gon the theodon absorbs the frequencies of the crown into itself to create another being this being is the dreamless during an intense battle Gian and Rover discover that the moon behind it is its core and dreamless is protecting it the battle rages on leading to Gian exhausting all his power and falling to his knees Rover limit breaks and rushes dreamless Abby absorbs some of dreamless frequencies resulting in a new level of power and abilities Havoc Rover eventually Rober and Gian defeat the dreamless as dreamless lay twisted and defeated the moon Retreats dreamless his body ignites and self-destructs in a powerful ball of energy this energy is absorbed by none other than Abby protecting everyone the being that was theorized to be inside of us earlier by B the same being that has been with us since we first began our journey and fought the crownless and the being that potentially was placed inside of us by the unknown God the rain subsides has it discords vanish the battle is [Music] one act seven of the story gives us a lot of background information on what characters were doing and just how things got to be the way they are basically the story centers around the secret that jinshi gave us earlier and that is Sentinel jet is missing so what happened to him well at some point in time before the rub woke up Scar and the fraus captured Sentinel J and they captured him for a few reasons one reason is that they wanted to resurrect the theodon of war and they didn't want Sentinel J disrupting their plans which is why they wanted to recruit Rover as well to keep him from getting in the way or possibly gain an ally to their plot another reason they captured jet is they knew jinshi would eventually seek out and potentially find J at the end of act seven jinshi resonates with Sentinel JS frequencies while overclocking creating her second Awakening the fraxus is dedicated to creating their own resonators and they're all about combining the powers and abilities of tcid discords and humans to create their own resonators in the past they had the court of savante research the second Awakening and at that time time it was just a theory understanding this process is super important for the fraus to complete their artificial resonator processes and finally be able to create resonators to rival the sentinel's power and while this isn't super important for their plans overall right now an additional reason why they captured J is likely because even though they learned a lot about J's powers from the court of Sante there's still more to gain if they can harness its abilities to manipulate time so what is the story of Mount firmament in J long ago Mount firmament was under attack and the City was destroyed by tcid discords to protect the people of Mount firmament and make sure it never happens again Sentinel J places a temporal barrier around Mount firmament this barrier causes time to flow very differently a century might pass on the outside of the barrier while only half a day might pass on Mount firmament making it nearly impossible for the average person to visit or come and go as they please once a person leaves Mount ferment their body would immediately experience the time difference causing their body to rapidly age a 100 years in a single instant during that attack long ago an infant was killed during the chaos of the Town being destroyed Sentinel jet resurrected this child and raised her as its own until she was a teenager then she would be sent to City Hall to become magistrate of gin Joe that child was Jin XI jinhi is Sentinel Jet's appointed resonator because with the current state of jet jingi finds her health and abilities diminishing so after the theodan threat Was Defeated jingi wastes no time heading to mount firmament to find out what happened to J the fraus revealed a prophecy from The Sentinel however jinhi was not surprised to hear it because J had already to her these things in the past after the battle of the trodon Ry heads to the hu Academy to receive checkup and B is able to confirm her theories about the being inside of our body she says that it shares frequencies similar to that of a tached Discord stored in a datab bank in other words it's our own personal Echo that we absorbed at some point in time it's determined that the Rob's relationship with Abby is a convergent codependent relationship so as one gets stronger so does the other and if one is harmed the other is too without us it cannot manifest all this brings into question what really is Abby baji goes on to say that in other countries there are highly intelligent Echo that can act on their own these types are highly involved in every aspect of human life there and their abilities are beyond our imaginations yangyang thinks about what bayi said saying that neither She nor B an expert in the field has ever seen one of the these types of Echoes in person but they believe it's possible that Abby could be such an echo Rover goes on to meet his friend yangyang and chisha at panoa restaurant where he shows off his new companion that sleeps within his body Abby well it isn't actually named at this point it wants a name and it eventually decides on the name Abby they ask it to demonstrate its power but it clearly doesn't know how which brings it the question under what circumstances do aby's abilities activate now that the crisis is over yangyang says we should seek out jinhi and Sentinel J for guidance and just debrief after the experience but after several days jinhi isn't back yet as we spend the next few days waiting for J shei Rover has a strange Vision when Abby and Rover discuss this Vision we learn that Rover recalls that there's a tazed Discord Outbreak on a mountain shaped like a dragon J saves the citizens by manipulating time creating a time barrier around the mountain which prevented TDS from entering of course we know this mountain to be Mount firmament and these things actually happen they briefly talk to two old men sitting nearby and one speaks about a far away land where there are other Echo potentially like Abby of course we now know this land is Renita the other old man explains that mount firmament is where the first people of ginjo came from and that it looks like a giant statue of Sentinel J sanwa reveals to us that magistrate Jin XI has gone to mount firmament alone to investigate The sentinel's Disappearance and she has not yet reported back sanoa wants Rover to help her find Jing she because she thinks she might be in danger she Wares that mount ferment is already a dangerous place and few people who've been there have managed to actually return so she sets up a meeting with a wayfinder who can guide us safely through the dangerous terrain barriers and temporal anomalies surrounding the mountain Rover and Abby prepared to head to the fery terminal to find the wayfinder and uncover what's really going on the wayfinder is CH Lee a dear friend and mentor to magistrate Jin XI she recognizes our resemblance to a person of Legend who was unaffected by the time altering effects of Mount fman Chang Lee suspects that the Rober has a deep connection to the Sentinel and is potentially linked to the ancient prophecies they set off together to rescue jinhi who is believed to be trying to stabilize the region eventually they reach Hong Den where it's overrun by fraxus artifac R and Chang Le find a hidden city shelter where they meet lady shinyi a retired City official aiding evacuees shinyi recounts Jin's recent activities including protecting locals and attempting to recover a p ier key to access the sentinel's resting place the meanong chamber jinshi while injured acknowledges the prophecy about her eventual clash with the Sentinel and her potential to surpass it in power aka the second Awakening because even though scar whispered some of this to her the Sentinel had already told her this long ago that they would have to fight and there would come a day when she would surpass it in power a day when the humans of ging Joe would take control of their own destiny shinyi Chung Le and Rover plan their next steps Chung Le and Rover will divert enemy forces at truth Seeker pass while shinyi prepares an ambush to protect the chamber as we come to truth seeker's pass we learn a lot more information about Sentinel J we learned that J had already sustained heavy injuries by the time he came to mount firmament it no longer had the ability to restore time instead he can only stop or rewind it this further explains why the time in M firmament is so strange Shang Le notes that J's injuries will keep getting worse and if J dies the temporal disruptions will spiral out of control engulfing all of Gan Joe the court of savante originally created Kronos sords to harness je powers for the second Awakening but every attempt failed they were in a complete failure as the devices still control time locally but to achieve what they wanted they needed more the second resonance Awakening hypothesis proposed a solution they postulated that the collision between two resonating frequencies might cause a second Awakening in a resonator giving them total control to manipulate time Rover recalls the prophecy talked about earlier and Chang Le agrees that fight has to happen to trigger the second Awakening for Jin XI so she may exert even stronger resonance abilities one that allows her to restore the flow of time they eventually find Jin she released J Rover transfers the temporal mandate to Jin and she fights J unleashing her second Awakening the flow of time around Mount firmament is restored and Gan Joe is saved after the ordeal Rover is allowed to ask jet a series of questions through them we get a glimpse into Rover's path we learned that J calls Rover Lord Arbiter as Rover is J's former master we ask J why we lost our memories and J straight up tells us that he doesn't know all of its knowledge comes from us and then J says this you said you planned to participate in history to make choices and witness the development of civilizations one had previously requested for permission to transform the temporal mandate to Jin shei as that is how one is designed to function if every ounce of my existence from life to death and even the passing on of power is subject to your approval and finally J leaves us with these words the black Shores is the starting point of your journey in this world if you have doubts this one suggests a visit to that land the weing waves ever flow they shall send you back to where you belong we've already covered most of the black Shore's plot during the prologue but I'll try to quickly connect the dots and summarize the basis of what happens for this part of the story due to the errors in te's core and the constant reanimation of simulated Souls of the port of guayu they start becoming sentient one former black Shores member who died in the incident is one of those simulations she's aware of the suffering and knows teus needs a new core she hatches a plot to bring Rover Back to Black Shores and potentially assimilate him into te's core Rover and Shor keeper explore the lament inside of teus and it snatches her up to use her at core though not human roor reviews shke keeper as more than just an artificial being he sees her Humanity we find out she was created to be te's core and we also find out that Rover even in the past didn't want to sacrifice her which is why he left black Shores in the first place place he wanted to find another way finally shke keeper substitutes a more calm and stable frequency for te's core and the day is saved sidebar that last part of the quest is somewhat frustrating because of the plot hole of why she no longer needed to be the core and why she just didn't do that before anyways that is the current story of weathering waves so far I'm really excited to see what the 2. X Series has in store for us also big big big shout out to Naro shio he played a big role in me having the footage I needed for this video I didn't have any footage for 1.1 or 1.0 and your guy hooked me up so if you guys haven't subscribed to him yet um give him a follow um thanks again nario that is all I have for you today for those of you who stuck around to the end hey man I really appreciate you this is by far my longest video and my first time doing something like this please be sure to share this video to other people you think might like it and if you're interested in discussing lore builds or just the game in general consider joining my Discord and until next time I'll catch you in the waves peace"
