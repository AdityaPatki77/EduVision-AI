    "summary": "This crash course introduces Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine.  It allows running JavaScript outside a browser, enabling backend development using familiar JavaScript skills.  Prerequisites include a strong understanding of JavaScript (ES6+, including arrow functions, array methods like map/filter/reduce, async/await, promises, and modules), basic client-side fetching, and JSON data handling.\n\nThe tutorial covers installing Node.js from nodejs.org and verifying the installation.  Key differences between browser and Node.js JavaScript are highlighted, such as the absence of the DOM in Node.js,  the use of the `global` object instead of `window`, and different module importing mechanisms (CommonJS `require` vs. ES6 `import`).\n\nA basic \"Hello World\" web server is created using the built-in `http` module, demonstrating server creation, request handling, and response sending.  The tutorial then explores the `process` object for accessing environment variables and the `fs` module for file system operations.  Asynchronous and synchronous file reading using `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync` are illustrated, showcasing Node.js's non-blocking nature and the impact of synchronous operations on code execution flow.  Finally, the concept of destructuring module imports is briefly introduced."
