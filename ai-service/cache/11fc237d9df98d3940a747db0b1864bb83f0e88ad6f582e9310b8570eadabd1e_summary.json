    "summary": "This tutorial by Kyle from WebDev Simplified covers building a backend with Express.js, a popular JavaScript framework.  After ensuring Node.js is installed and initializing a project with `npm init -y`, the tutorial guides viewers through installing Express (`npm i Express`) and Nodemon (`npm i -save-dev nodemon`) for easier server restarts.  A `dev start` script using Nodemon is set up for automatic server restarts on code changes.\n\nThe core of the tutorial focuses on creating and handling routes within Express.js.  The instructor demonstrates creating a basic server using `const app = express();` and starting it with `app.listen(3000)`.  He then explains how to define routes using methods like `app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... });`, handling GET requests.  The tutorial covers sending responses using `res.send()`, `res.status()`, and `res.json()`, illustrating how to return different HTTP status codes and JSON data to the client.  The importance of using `res.json()` for sending JSON data in APIs is highlighted.  Finally, the video briefly touches upon using `res.download()` for sending files.  The tutorial emphasizes the simplicity and flexibility of Express.js for building robust backend applications."
