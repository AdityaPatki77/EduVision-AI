    "summary": "This One Punch Man timeline analysis details the events leading to Saitama's final confrontation with God, spanning 300 million years.  It begins with the prehistoric Terror Lizard Clan's war, culminating in Ancient King's survival and eventual death.  God's influence is hinted at through ancient murals.  Millions of years later, humanity undergoes three eras of change: inter-tribal warfare, climate change migration, and the rise of monsters.  Dr. Genus's evolution theories emerge during this period, alongside the Hero Association's formation and the rise of powerful heroes like Blast and Tatsumaki.  Saitama's birth triggers a prophecy for Boros, leading to his invasion.  Simultaneously, the Monster Association forms, spearheaded by Orochi, culminating in a large-scale war.  Saitama's rigorous training unintentionally breaks God's imposed human limitations.  The Monster Association's attack, featuring powerful cadres like Garo and Psykos, leads to numerous battles and reveals God's manipulation through Psykos and Homeless Emperor.  Tatsumaki's battle with Psykos-Orochi fusion, Saiko, showcases immense power, but God's interference and the emergence of Cosmic Garo, God's new avatar, raises the stakes.  Saitama's final battle with Garo, involving time travel and multiversal implications, concludes with Garo's defeat and Saitama's memory loss.  The threat of God, however, remains, setting the stage for a future conflict."
