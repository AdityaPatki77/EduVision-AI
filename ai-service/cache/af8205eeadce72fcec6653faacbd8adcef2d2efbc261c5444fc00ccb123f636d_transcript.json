looks like a knife wait it is a knife yeah don't mess up your sword so this man will kill you personally looking good [Music] are we surprised to be fair it looks cooler now what in the whole Harry Potter is this is that Manan the ultimate crossdresser you know I wouldn't mess with M like that can't say I didn't warn you so this guy was the only one that survived and he is not mentally stable that is the peak of a menace even goano looking sad it is the guy from before that makes sense yeah that's a Wifey right there yes me and the boys doing some blowing imagine getting told off by grade schoolers why ride a train when you can become one with it that's at least what inosi thought now you done it the poo is after you and there they go on their next mission isn't it mad how s I'm sorry isn't it mad how [ __ ] ass [ __ ] boy is the normal one right now had to drag our boy and his fake ass outline out of here excuse me just passing by excuse me stop and here is where we get introduced to a certain flame hasera who likes to scream out his opinions on things preferably in public how does he no SK always end up in a goofy ass position bro [ __ ] how many of them Ys did you finish does all your nutrition go to your eyebrows cuz God damn we need a HED stream over here yeah we are still not sure if this guy is mentally stable but after some back and forth he does the [ __ ] pat pat in combination with this devious ass side eyes I don't even know what feeling he's trying to convey but they sit down and yo senu can you please get a hold on your mans thank you as I was saying they sit down and have a heartfelt Dad toon conversation as this man has daddy issues while homie thefuck de just don't have one but for some reason rang Goku is locked in on something off screen cuz he ain't keeping eye contact maybe Tano just have foul as breath man and here is where homeboy trying to figure out how he did his old but R Goku not trying to share that information gas light gate keep go ball you dig so the reason why he even is here is because people just be disappearing and [ __ ] and it's probably because of some freaky ass demon bro homie done [ __ ] up with this job I haven't seen his wife and kids in years this show really doesn't care about getting down to B no animation no nothing for this [ __ ] but this is still no match for Ang Goku as he cooks his ass in seconds but then Daddy Long Legs comes out to play and inosi thinking is his turn to clap some sheeks runs in head first only to get put on his ass by Flame daddy himself clean that [ __ ] up as well let's go and after dead ass cooking two demons this free jump straight on homeboy's dick like God damn this man saved your sister and your ass but he ain't got [ __ ] like senu go so excited his [ __ ] overbite got off the bench you even got the no skin meat munching that's crazy so apparently I was right about his ass not seeing his family cuz them [ __ ] are six feet under while homie has lost his mind talking to a walking hand but this hand on on demon [ __ ] and put this man in a genjitsu and moves on to Gaslight some children into committing third deegree murder like [ __ ] me home girl in the back ain't even woken up yet yeah I forgot to mention but the squad is dead asleep but this ain't no normal dream n they got put in their happy place so the kids can wrap up their activity fast and efficiently Tano go to play House s on his honeymoon with an underage girl and he knows SK off the rooms meanwhile this is the demon behind all this and he's sesty as [ __ ] touching himself in a way that makes me uncomfortable little [ __ ] belongs to me so basically these kids get sapped into their dreams in some weird way and have to find their Cor and stabbed at her and the first one to be found is rang Goku but he could even in his sleep and put his gorilla ass grip around her neck and now this [ __ ] falls out like a bubbling ball just to cremate her brother live on the scene yeah that makes tan ball single a bit and he decides to leave the fam and [ __ ] kill himself all it's time to get to work still clean with it as always of course he runs off the demon like the night shining armor that is [ __ ] stupid bro yeah he hit him with some deep quot on the better in his head and go crazy with his water dragon before one move put him to sleep again but Tano ain't dumb enough to fall for the same trick twice and packs his ass up literally committing mass murder and the only victim is him yeah now this cringe ass demon is fusing with the train or some weird [ __ ] you can hear how disappointed I am in my tone of voice that this [ __ ] just didn't die neso is out there doing more cremation and now these free start cooking until neso gets put in some illegal MMA move Thunder breathing first form save my wifeu wait he can do that yeah I don't know and now flame daddy is back in Action [ __ ] everything up making this guy feel things meanwhile yeah tan Ro and inosi link up in one of the cleanest tag team Duos we will ever see to finish this train up for good somehow we got teleported to the UK again but they still clean [ __ ] up and crashed the whole [ __ ] train yo your [ __ ] ass all right where where the [ __ ] have you been n you see me I was just dealing with some of the female passengers you feel me [ __ ] you mean you were dealing with some of the female passenger you know [ __ ] is about to go south when there's 30 minutes left and the movie should already be over introducing akasa the upper ranked demon with his own theme song and for some godown reason he ain't messing with Tango and go straight for his skull hey man you need to sit your mother [ __ ] ass God damn split his army in two and here these two start getting into some verbal disagreement as iess I want to see your boy switch sides but of course that [ __ ] ain't working so he gets mad and pulls out his signature move already they both get to work while homeboy still trying to gas light R Goku to rat bro we are so [ __ ] just as it looks like everything is going downhill R Goku finally releases his ultimate and go crazy but akasa is also locked in ready to go Ren Goku coming through on some real main character [ __ ] slicing up this ugly ass demon [ __ ] we might even win this [ __ ] this failed art piece maxed out this region thatat just for this moment and packed my man up [ __ ] got hit so hard he's having flashbacks it's over ladies and gentlemen but flame daddy ain't about to l down and die so he try to take akasa with him but the Sun comes around and messes up the whole scene and now this [ __ ] just runs away with all his arms and a sword in his neck but he doesn't seem to care at all Tano not trying to act all big after laying there watching his gang die and he pierced him right through his chest but he's still cool and continues to yog away yeah now we get this tear Fest where homie passes away smiling and [ __ ] while tenisu pulls up from nowhere with his girl on his back and starts talking emotional after doing Yak [ __ ] for the whole sequence you know this is actually kind of sad but I didn't get to know bro so I don't really care so the bird tells the rest of the street that their blood got cleaned up while AKA over here with Mr Mand the third asking for some praise cuz he don't hash you think such a simple task would please my Hunger for Conquest thou foul demon what why are you talking like that shut up I Am Lord musan the greatest demon to ever walk this puny Planet you're weird for real what now we cool boss we straight [ __ ] all of you are so [ __ ] stupid I can't believe I have to do this [ __ ] after a thousand [ __ ] years and now akasa gone out there beating the [ __ ] out of T's blade cuz baby man is mad he didn't receive no praise from Daddy Manan so now we back at shinobu's place where senu is still getting violated yeah tan out here on a light Yol with a hole in his stomach after he got delivered the UK special anyway he runs into roku's brother and dad and tell them that their Mas got wrapped up and totally out of pocket their dad starts roasting his dead son and then beats the [ __ ] out of his other one Tano tries to step in but ends up in the same position oh man out there using his head again after gaining absolute no information about his fire dragon he heads back just to run into homeboy with his horse again so these three start working on the craft Tano claps another lowy ass demon and now this random ass man is just Al her stealing kids while Mrs mute over here is trying her best I guess Tano goes to use his head again but this man ain't letting that [ __ ] connect so apparently he needs them females for a mission God knows what he's planning but t on the gang steps up and after violating her definitely putting him on some register the four of them are off y all don't mind being Sol off as woman right hey yeah they call it the Entertainment District but this is the kind of entertainment for your pocket rocket y dig this 12T tall man with no eyebrows has some serious gold complex going on even inos couldn't say anything to that [ __ ] become less rendered by the day so they arrive at the red light district where even homeboy can get some play and now they for having some secret meeting where senitsu is ConEd out T is bullshitting and inosi devouring some food but he wakes up after hearing that they got sent here to search for big man's free wives but he put his ass back to sleep then inosi dropped this out of pocket comment and ends upop in the same way looks like usui had enough of this [ __ ] and decided to sell off the boys to sex worker this this is some real sorry ass character development as inosi runs off to get a glimpse of some bombass [ __ ] you know when these characters are gleam the [ __ ] out they will never see the daylight again just trust me so he know he gets sold offense and need to still out on the streets having to result to playing through fire in the Flames so of course our pretty boy Tano is the only one to actually get [ __ ] done and even outter struggling to light to get some information of Miss Beauty over here homeboy should be putting a slice of Life anime instead bro now we getting from Back to the 1940s where this sh finally figure out that there's some funny business going on but she never got to live to tell the tale this this is how y'all [ __ ] be looking like when going to Japan so here is wife number one being all wrapped up in some Demon business you see I was going to comment about her assets but I felt like that was just low hanging fruit at this point but she can always hang her fruit in my face butoski already on the case causing casualties in the process like God damn homeboy just wanted some puss meanwhile senu ran into the damn demon washing her bullies some kids or whatnot and even he couldn't let that [ __ ] slide ends up getting messed up by a pull and shoot counter McGregor would be proud of but it's a fault that counts you take some to get some you feel me but this demon is low ranking [ __ ] nah she's out there dropping people from 20 ft in the air in her [ __ ] ass get up and let's not get this Twisted she is 1 years old and I don't care about this chronologically she's 100 [ __ ] it's just a whole trap and I'm not talking a good kind after packing up the head of the house she rolls away and runs into the man himself MJ and this girl is like real down bad for him and of course as the Playboy he is he notices and starts playing with the girl feelings you've been doing beats out here on these streets I see you I see you don't sleep up though cuz the Ops be on you and I didn't make you an upper rank for nothing so don't disappoint me I you got it Daddy I mean Lord missan I'm so wet right now what the episode ends with senu Rising off the sh when he tried to save and then with some comedial ass cut off gets wrapped up himself so now two3 of the squad is meeting up with no throwing up some gang signs how the [ __ ] apparently usui got carried away cuz he was too horny and tells the gang to leave but you know what these two are so they start doing some investigation on their own Tano leaves the house after getting exposed that they already knew his ass was a man she tells him that she's also leav because of marriage and stuff but she didn't even have time to finish her makeup before she got done de meanwhile inosi trying to get his drip back and C up some mice on steroids yeah I don't know man but no he's ready to go usui however has totally switched sides going off the random civilians just to get laid bro he's such a s trying to rescue his wives and [ __ ] so Tango finds the demon with his vacuum cleaner off a nose hey you let go of that woman yeah here he start realizing that he might have bit off more than he could sh but anyways they start going at it while neso is left on the sidelines so her whole thing is that she traps people in her clothes to devour them later or some [ __ ] sophisticated ass demon bro so Tangen finally finds his first wife putting him in a little better mood where is this demon at man I need to do everything myself in this [ __ ] yeah he hears the sound of battle on the ground and decides to dig straight down on the spot Tango still trying to learn how to breathe and then up getting beat the [ __ ] up finding out that he ain't buil like that but just because he's Tano he finds the strength to look back in last second and they go back to 100% in no still trying to find the cloth he was searching for before [ __ ] dislocates all his joints to do the worm so he finds St his whole stash of food and some part of the cloth ain't happy with the intrusion so they start to fight and by pure mistake he manages to save T against two other wives but they don't get along on rendering inos all over again and here is the first time I have seen senu lock in from the start and clear the whole house okay it's kind of cool how did it take that long to get there you started digging at midnight anyways he takes a hit and cleans up the rest yeah apparently he has been with this three for a long time bagging the whole village is actually crazy but we could also just leave this one out you know two that bad how do you even get one when things finally start going kind of decent for her boy she gets on weird ass power up and now a random NPC trying to act all tough but duy ain't playing these games and [ __ ] up the whole street this was the last drop for homeboy like I know he about to go crazy grabbing her leg on some real demon time just look at my man's face let's check up on the gang [ __ ] me fortunately T you're on duy you're having some kind of political debate about pain and suffering and you notice is serious when the main character ain't even blinked once no way back to throwing hands when her boy pulls out this beautiful move God damn he is cooking her even Landing a hit but she's still on her [ __ ] so he has to go again look at the moves look at the angles look at the nah [ __ ] off learn how to breathe and now she thinks she did

styles to make this beautiful ass water fire dance to save her skin and here comes Tangen trying to finish the job but somehow he managed to block that [ __ ] and take homeboy with him yeah now all

crying [ __ ] ass bit homie finally woke up and I hate him already he know is done messed up but with some more creation he's back online tenen is a little more [ __ ] and he has to listen to this three argue before meeting rang Goku yeah no one really knows how this [ __ ] works it's a whole ass Miracle let's wrap this up with this two still going at it so the last season ended with the gang all on 1 HP but they still vibing while the blind Master got too excited and started bleeding out of course Mr musan didn't like the fact that one of his gang got packed up by a group of teenage boys and a child so he put in that emergency meeting but akasa doesn't seem to know where he is what the [ __ ] I was just home reading the fourth volume of woman's rights for the third time and now I'm here [ __ ] man I was just about to get to the good part two why does Manan always do this [ __ ] so akasa arrives while this [ __ ] is still out there playing her trash music and now we are introduced to the first dick weed of the Season who is this nasty ass dude in a pot homeboy felt a little goofy too so he switched the placements of his eyes and mouth mouths this [ __ ] got too Mouse anyways they tried to do a cool introduction slide for him but there's no redeeming qualities for this man and here is the second diid who's just a whole [ __ ] ass [ __ ] with the biggest sist I have ever seen but it seems like he's in a gang or some [ __ ] cuz he be throwing them things up you didn't forget about me did you my little cutie patoti aasa oh my god dude that would make me really really sad don't touch me how have you been my little cranberry so this CES Goa is the upper rank two which means he's a better Dick Rider than akasa and he makes sure he knows that fact he even managed to weird out the man with no hips that's crazy and then he dropped this Auto pocket comment like he has some serious beef with arasa say what again I dare you I devil dare you [ __ ] that [ __ ] was so smooth that the cameraman have a problem knowing where to look yeah he justed attack on tight and that [ __ ] and apparently the upper rank one has been here the entire time too just sitting here alone dick in hand waiting for Manan and speaking about Manan har he is in his crack lab cooking up some real good stuff if you know what I mean yeah now he's angry for some reason and snaps at his co-workers and even beheads the port guy but he's too horny to be felt up by his daddy so that doesn't work yo musan what the [ __ ] are you doing no these two are on the way to Merk the swordsmith village and of course this lightskinn one to come with [ __ ] out of here with your [ __ ] ass M sign gave you orders didn't he AA [ __ ] I should I quit smoking so this butterfly eyed big boy is the upper rank one Coco something and he's a scary ass dude even got akasa to cooperate anyways he disconnects and now we back to our homeboy tanyo who looks totally messed up Bo know wait what he has apparently been offline for two whole months after his crap with sticks and twigs look at everyone being emotional and in line with their feelings so the rest of the gang seem to be okay with senu already out on a mission and tenen straight up walked home directly from the battle scene inos seem to be a little more critical than the rest because of the extreme stabbing he received okay then I must really be tripping because I see him stuck to the ceiling you really fought a man that can relocate his organs would die nah he was back on his [ __ ] a week ago it took him about 10 seconds before he started something I think we would be better off if he didn't wake up after 16 broken bones 23 severe fractures to his skull and losing one arm Tanny Rose back on his feet after only one week the plot armor kicks in for this dude even when he's not in danger inos already pieced out and senu is still not back fortunately if that [ __ ] was in this season you would never have seen this video by the way big up all the senu haters out there homeboy however still on his rehabilitating Journey gets a letter from the guy that has been his biggest op since season 1 hauka aka the guy that makes his swords this is the type of [ __ ] they found by the Zodiac Killer anyways to get a new sword he has to go to the hidden Leaf Village oh sorry wrong anime the hidden sours Smith Village and talk it out face to face and this Village is like super hidden so he has to wear both a blindfold and nose plugs because you know he got that [Music] nose so we make it to the Village safe and S but I don't even know if this counts as a village cuz there's like eight houses in total with about 12 people living here anyways he thanks the Shi and heads out meanwhile whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hey so you miss the leader of this Village who's this microorganism and now this slowy side character is showing him around and this way leads to the hot springs the only place in this village where you can find bad [ __ ] oh yes thank you very much sir this place has helped me many times with my hammerers oh my God look at him being being respectful or whatever but either way this is one of the hash of this season yeah you get two this time around but this one is the one I relentlessly bullied in my first video and I have no reason to stop so if you like this [ __ ] strap in or maybe strap on I don't judge anyways now he finally about to soak up in the hot springs but he gets a [ __ ] two thr to his head and guess who it is the angry ass teenage boy who got his [ __ ] rocked by non other than homeboy in like episode five Tano still trying to introduce himself but get reacted on the spot leaving him wondering what he ever did wrong bro I swear this girl has the appetite of a small horse God damn calm down and when did you two become best friends whatever she Whisperers some seductive [ __ ] in his ear that must 100% count as sexual harassment and now he's heading out I need to find that weapon mystery was talking about but where just give me the key [ __ ] face what did you just call me it's my mask and no I won't give it to you what is going on just give me the key dick wrinkle what yeah Tanya Roy is watching a full-blown hashira and a kid no more than 10 going at it before he pulls out the physical violence which is a clear red flag Tano steps in but hom is like your voice is mad annoying who are you my name is Tano don't care weak ass so this whole screamish is because homeboy wants the key to the robot that looks like that one op old dude but the kid who somehow built it won't let it go Tano is doing what he does best and gets laid out flat again can't catch a break can you that kid is going head to-head with the robot she he kind of good and why does this Crow have eyelashes of course he has to smash the robot which makes penis mouth run away and cry but with some motivation from our homeboy we go back and check out the damage nah just kidding he's back in Action baby but this kid is not satisfied and forced Tano into our training scheme to beat Miss boy it ain't looking too good though his favorite position has been the floor for the past episode and a half how is Tano letting this kid treat him this way dog looking like that one alien meme but if you know anything about Tano it is that it will always beat when whatever is in front of him sooner or later this time he won in the most goofy way possible but adub is adub he broke that joint so bad the whole sword came out oh my God time to unbox this bad [Music] boy yeah what did you expect is 300 years old when talking about special swords only one man will appear the Hulk no it's [ __ ] hauka he was not built like this before bro anyways he wants the sword after some backup small talk and some more [ __ ] he ends up taking it back to fix it up now Tano somehow made it inside genya's room but that doesn't last long damn she getting those misery braids if you don't know how to braid hit that follow button let's go ah that was a refreshing bath I can't wait to get home and cry myself to sleep because there are literally zero women in this shitty town huh is that a pot hm that's weird I should totally reach inside he turned that [ __ ] inside out still with the ass gone meanwhile Tano almost got suffocated by Miss boy and now we start becoming best friends before this Ebola ass demon comes in from nowhere homie can get his hands out of his ass but tokido doesn't waste any time and goes in for the kill but he's fast as [ __ ] Tano already pulls out a sun breathing but mes so neso has to step in and demolish his ass they are yumping this man didn't even give him a chance but of course this upper ranked demon has more smoke stocked up cuz he split into a whole another person Toyo tries the same thing again but this demon ain't dealing with this [ __ ] no more now we lost Miss boy while nugo and homeboy stand head-to-head with the now two [ __ ] ass demons oh my God bro why did I have to be teamed up with your ugly ass again bro we look the same shut up yeah he electrifies the whole Battleground while Tano is getting cooked alive okay this is really bad I'm getting tingles all the way down to my ball sack I must do something wait does that does that man have a blicky this man genya pulled up with the sord of shotgun like where was this [ __ ] two seasons ago anyways he beheads the two thinking he's the main character but they just end up multiplying again Tano gets kidnapped off the Jump while he tries to tell NES to go to help genya but he already passed on homeboy is still trying his best outter like I got this I just need to release my ultimate and I gave you all what the freak [ __ ] is the YY demon that's cringe and if you fought homeboy died he didn't because he's just built like that but y boy is not done and he's already going for round two you all my love pokyo is still trying to get back to his click while he runs into this kid fighting this crackhead fish but he just ignores it calling it a low priority and to be honest he's not wrong nah he turns back and saves the kid yeah so they team up while Tano managed to slice up homeboy once more but that doesn't do [ __ ] and he hits him with a double speaker instead you so there are four total versions of this one demon anger YY sorrow and pleasure in other words league players delusional league players and warm water in the morning yeah they continue to go back and forth while nugo is over here with Leaf boy while the angry one has apparently taken the role as the team leader cuz he's out there Throwing Shade to all his homies what the [ __ ] are you doing kill that [ __ ] oh you're making me really angry right now [ __ ] all my business gang my name is literally pleasure so you know what I'm about to get into huh Dash she can't be right well whatever I'm too depressed to say anything now this black Air Force fuel [ __ ] pulls out his Bley again and just decapitates blue boy but he just rips out his spirit that leaves gen call when he starts chanting some magic spell to get a full regen he almost got his get back too but the team leader got to him first he did manage to get one last shot off that actually hits but in reality it won't do Yak [ __ ] will it green boy decides that he done playing around and puts a whole ass foot for a home girl but you know neso ain't no B either and comes back with the kick from Hell deleting his whole Y and she Ain't Even Done Yet now she pulls out her fire and starts cooking him alive while ripping off his arm and using his own leaf against him give up meanwhile this [ __ ] has just been standing here talking [ __ ] the entire time don't talk [ __ ] you [ __ ] ass [ __ ] yeah this [ __ ] can't be legal blue boy still over here with genya who's trying to contact the gods and it seems like he got some kind of connection cuz now he's back online tangu somehow manages to crash right into the building while fighting bird boy and see the monstrosity that is going on to his sister rule number one has always been don't [ __ ] with his family or you will find out oh my God neso are you all right here let me help help you good night little boy uh no way I'm a goner here comes neso with her inhuma forearm strength and then throw some more Fireballs at homie but now this dude comes back from the lobby and just knocks them both out look at them appreciating their work like they almost didn't get folded by high schoolers meanwhile we have another big problem in the city as these crackhead fishes are causing trouble like this dude is desperate to get some help now we back with Toyo and this kid still running when they find another random NPC stuck in a tree I swear if he just removed his penis mask and used his knife he would be fine but anyways this man actually knows where to get tokido a new sword though so no all three team up yeah of course this put [ __ ] is camping The Sword and tokido is out there like step aside useless Side characters I'll handle this so he's out there introducing himself while the city is lowkey burning but then miss radish finally shows up and saves the ass like she wasn't already two episodes late and bro all these [ __ ] totally forgot about the task at hand cuz they are all looking this [ __ ] is over here like H what they don't even care about their homeboy bleeding out anymore home girl however is [ __ ] up all the fishes and then just leaves the chief is also in trouble with a maxed out Magikarp literally squeezing him to death but somehow she already there and just wraps up the whole thing like all bullying aside she got a [ __ ] on look though with her sword whip Miss radish is scared for homeboy's life while he's out here like can you please jig yeah this side character also tries his luck but if you have under five lines in the whole season you ain't getting nothing and Ro back to what he knows best which is running but he just ends up getting blasted again now we in a big pickle big pickle why did I say that now the squad is in big trouble but nugo doesn't want to let go of the blade she gripping onto that joint so tight like she have abandonment issues T Ro see these two walking around looking for their ass so he start getting nervous nugo I swear to God let go of my [ __ ] blade or S won't be able to milk this series any longer Yoko is still shatting [ __ ] when he pulls out his masterpiece which is this leaning tower of victims and these people are still alive okay that's enough screen time if I want to earn any money so he's still taunting their ass while mishiro had enough and go straight for the neck but homeboy can apparently teleport from pot to PO I don't even have time to commentate cuz this hashira don't [ __ ] talk anyways gyoko start getting mad cuz he sliced up his vase and pulls out Finding Nemo's fat cousins that unloads a whole stack of nails but our home booy just weaves it yeah they turn their ass around and go for the easy kills instead ain't no way dude no way the guy that was beating up this kid in episode 2 is no taking a bullet for him this [ __ ] turns so soft after meeting homie man even tries to slash again but ends up getting caught in literal water I wonder what Tano is up to going [ __ ] crazy okay let's go kill them ho oh he pulled out the sun breathing first from drama on the ass oh he clean with it let's go oh [ __ ] genya is still alive too how we don't know even got one of the Demons too okay wait something ain't right here oh hell no let's just ignore the fact that genya switch teams cuz now neso and homeboy is hugging it out like we already finished the Y but there's like five more episodes left so they better lock back in you eat all my beans [ __ ] oh [ __ ] okay he's totally messed up anyways he links up with nesso while homie goes off looking for the main body these Powerpuff demons are so annoying I swear they Ain in the plot progress here comes home girl with those dirty white socks of hers trying to end red boy but gets impaled instead it seems like t r second dose of PL armor kicked in because now the table so slightly turning nugo gives out another serving of cremation while gya actually finds the main body in this small little [Music] [ __ ] no way he missed with a short gun at that distance bro and he talked about wanting to become a hasher as well the hasher of what folding he eventually lands his stord but this little [ __ ] doesn't skip neck day and snaps that joint in too even ends it with back shots but that doesn't do [ __ ] damn this is it for me I'm sorry brother for being a little [ __ ] to the end Goodbye World why is this taking so God I'm yeah we get a backstory for him now and if you didn't know he's the brother of that crazy whad hasher so basically their story goes something like their dad was abusive mother turned to a demon and killed everyone excluding the ones that looked a little bit different that white hair had to execute her enough to cause trauma for a family of four but of course he doesn't die because Mister everything is going to be okay he's back to save his skin then about 1 minute later he gets handed the most absurd ass whooping I have ever seen like I can't even show this [ __ ] but it tells Tano to finish it up and now we back to running I have no [ __ ] I have no oh my God he's really fast but I'm not letting you get away this time flame on [ __ ] yeah let's go cut that neck boy oh my God why is he screaming the demon is back fuse together with the rest of the gang and summon this big ass wooden dragon that almost ends homeboy if it weren't for nugo who's somehow still walking yeah Twitter will have a f day with this shot right here anyways this dude is really pissed off using hard words I don't understand [ __ ] is cold for real though this pure presence makes tiny R the squad piss their pants and because we got stuck with these goody two shoes as a main character they start having an ideology of Fano is [ __ ] cross side yeah this is a whole mess meanwhile mishiro is still stuck in his squirt you and has no way to get out so he just gives up [ __ ] wake up nah he gets enlightened by positive energy himself and decides to not kick the bucket yet Mr Port [ __ ] has now made his way inside the shed and removes NPC number 24 like he was about to do [ __ ] now let's see what's so important huh is that man really crafting a sword while his blood is bleeding out behind him I don't like this pay attention to my beautiful faces so he starts tearing into Hagan esuka but he doesn't bad ey and continue working like he got bills to pay now this piss kid comes back and tries to get homeboy out but ends up getting stabbed in the process okay [ __ ] a backstory motherfucker's mom is hooping with Kobe after his sorry ass dad fell off a cliff while his pissed off twin brother got that dog kicked out of him by a demon now he's ready to get his get back against gyoko and even manag to scratch him before he pulls out a monster fucker's Wildest Dream and crashes the whole shed homeboy goes straight back to sharpening the sword while tokido turned to f up and uses all the season budget to almost finish him off like he was going crazy in that joint now this whole show turned to one of those roast battles in wild and out but this is so one-sided that it's more like a public execution this man muichiro is literally out there saying it's not like I'm underestimating you I'm just stating a fact too cold man he even went after his vase which turned homie inside out so he frow out another fish related attack but with homeboy already locked in this is already game G I said ready two times in the same sentence that's crazy but just as that one spider dude in season one Yoko evolves to whatever this is now behold my true beauty oh I've been waiting to show this off only two people have ever seen this form and they are both dead dead as hell isn't it totally the greatest thing you have ever seen say something at least oh my bad I was just thinking about when Frank Ocean is dropping yeah yo straight on timing trying to box with mishiro but he just smoke screens the whole place and what this man does next is so disrespectful that he should just be locked up on the spot first he give him this devious ass grin then walks up to him while still talking [ __ ] and cuts his head off clean like one of those satisfying soap videos and don't forget this was an upper Moon he was fighting like there's no funny business either like he got a third form or something nah he is dead homeboy himself was running on pure adrenaline too though looking like me when I wake up now we back to this wooden Dragon who can apparently mix and match all the emotions attacks and blast tyo with some more trash music before breaking his back and trapping the other two he even got that arer treatment except he can't turn into a Titan but he does have a big TI hashira that saves the day by coming late twice in a row almost got my bingo card filled out but anyway she tried to compliment him but his air drums literally got blown out a few seconds ago so he can't hear [ __ ] pointing a sword that ain't hard at someone is not intimidating shut up ho ass [ __ ] as I said before this girl is too goofy to be a hasher bro but she starts cooking in style with all her love breathings but right as she about to finish the yob she also get blasted with the same trash music Tano had turned your the only difference is that she did not take it as well this woman is actually pretty strong I never thought I would see the day don't tell a though well whatever it's still game over [Music] though what the [ __ ] as you know by now I don't care for flashbacks so let's just sum it up by saying that this this girl was built since birth and embarrassed grown as men but because of that no one wanted to marry her so she joined the corpse to find a real man and of all people in the squad she shows the depressed e boy I anyways now these four all hugging as she starts sping some nonsense about friendship that she T has been preaching about since episode 1 now everyone go back to 100% with mystery handling the angry teenager while these Boy Scouts run away to find the main body and there it is Lo in boys yeah they start to slice and Di andya even starts eating that [ __ ] because they missed out on dinner while nuko comes in with the assist as they managed to slice it [Music] open all right dude what the flip little ho tried to ski that all way but Tango Ain leted that [ __ ] slide again so now he's back to running [ __ ] I'm getting tired by just washing this [ __ ] genya what are you doing gya oh hell no he be out there throwing free now what the [ __ ] he really dash in making gen extra pissed off and now we get another only Tino moment as this [ __ ] learns Thunder breathing in seconds oh my God sometimes we need to start questioning the things this man does he even got a broken foot right now yeah the demon becomes a little mad that his head is about to come clean off so he grows a little bit and puts his nasty hands around our homeboy's face [ __ ] belongs to me Kenya finally arrives and needs another Soundwave before neso comes back and throws out some more of her blood that luckily Saves the Day hom not coming through with that last push rips both of his arms off better scramble like an egg before you get folded like an AR niggaer o that brother's fting [ __ ] man I try to warn him that I see red when I'm angry the demon no thinking the yobi stun run after some random civilians to get his tree cred back up while Tano stuck in a tree somehow muichiro who has been absent for three episodes come back and hooks him up with a new Sword without tanuka's permission of course now he mixes Thunder breathing with his Sun breathing like it wasn't ridiculous enough and goes crazy [Music] I'm about to lose my voice right now but if I weren't I would be screaming cuz this is so beautiful that I'm almost shedding tears we get anyways now a new predicament appears as the sun is about to come up but nugo is still wide open and just to pour more salt into all the wounds the demon didn't die because it wasn't his main head head this is a whole mess Hao is getting a panic attack genya is about to fall off the cliff and mishiro is taking a nap what the [ __ ] should he do no let go yo that's my bad I'm sorry I'm sorry Tano now realizing what he has to do he both locked in and pissed off but he don't care and blows his brains out [ __ ] him up Tano oh yeah oh yeah he's going crazy let's go it's not that weird that his body finally gives out after all this [ __ ] while someone I assume is gya is walking all drunk towards him after not doing [ __ ] to save neso no way no way right [ __ ] on my front porch her ass is alive and even regain the ability to speak I wonder what her first words is going to [Music] be hey yo on champ pull up Mis was also on her way out but just in the nick of time he gets snapped away yeah they all reunite and hug it out before Tano leaves the village toad back into a coma again while the villagers are working overtime to get their houses back what a wholesome ending excuse me Mr musan we bring some tea oh wow what a mess you need to start taking better care of this room shut your [ __ ] ass up oh [ __ ] I finally found someone that can withstand this son I just need to absorb her and then the world will be mine so we start off nowhere near where the last season ended so homeboy might be dead for all we know sadly for us we get to see emo boy and scarf freak with two other NPCs who definitely won't be seen again apparently it's another doctor disrespect demon situation going on running around kidnapping woman and that can't slide so the squad moves out meanwhile this demon is over here like damn I knew I should have killed them [ __ ] yesterday calm down little bro you're not him the corpse finally pulls up but it looks like the two strongest people there got tired cuz they stopped running and started speed walking instead they make it inside is cross the ass abandoned castle and these two can already smell that has walked in on a swinger party even the snake is disgusted with this [ __ ] one of the Demons is ready to yump NPC number one to get his streak R up but gets cut in Free by a sword who defies physics but we are beyond that at this point scar guy is also ready as we both start carrying the team packing them up with malicious intent NPC are ready on the floor but get saved by another one of his kind meanwhile the duo have already started hitting trick shots on their ass they should have put these [ __ ] in face instead of that sorry ass lineup [ __ ] we in a new phase anyways they finish it up and you stand there like their battery ran out as emo guy says but I'll slide shobis digidots okay they go back to yapping about how this just doesn't feel right as we hear one of the hostages is still alive so Mr scar yumps right into action with wind Brea in second form I had Taco Bell for lunch back to back serpent dude comes out and turns his joint into a whole snake which cleans up the rest beauti done and we only three minutes in homeboy still holding that I'm him post and just for now I let him have it cuz that was kind of clean BR what the [ __ ] is wrong with you stupid [ __ ] demon over here with shy is lowkey pissing himself so he does the dash and just because of his [ __ ] ego he doesn't run after him but walks homie wanted to be in an edit so bad the demon does not fall for this e boy first trap [ __ ] and yumps out on a [ __ ] trampoline and flies up scar guy can't catch a break as F know sent out the dogs get the [ __ ] out of here little [ __ ] emo boy pulls up and tells white boy to save the woman he definitely drops the hard R anyways he throws himself off the roof back first confusing the [ __ ] out of the Demons but that doesn't last long as he hits them with some Instant Transmission [ __ ] and finish them off Mr scar finally cornered the demon and in one last attempt of yumping him they get hit with a [ __ ] tornado yeah homeboy really doesn't even like her like that and just throws her off the roof but of course emo boy is right there home run they are not satisfied though and start to chase this [ __ ] down but chat are we cooked yeah they lost his ass homie does not have the brain power to understand what just happened and where did shorty go they just left her ass and in the next scene she was gone now we back to the peace and quiet literally as she know bulaki is right back from a mission [ __ ] knows why I'm even covering this [ __ ] anyways apparently nugo is being held safe somewhere and is not allowed to see her brother which got her in distress what no D shobu looking bad as always and Tano seemed to be alive at least just [ __ ] shatting away with my favorite NPC now we get to see all the big boys scattered again it's been a while so let's go through them all we have blind Brooke White freak horny radish the child emo boy depression and shinobu emo boy froze out some sincere words to the child and radish off their scrap with the upper moons and this horny ass [ __ ] is already in heat I'm over here stroking my dick I got lotion on my dick so it seems like the old man have finally hit his breaking point and can't come in person anymore about time if you ask me this is his wife and Child by the way definitely not robots they talk about the marks that give them that random power up and how they can make them appear without being on the brink of death after going through the whole [ __ ] history and glazing t or some more they asked the two worst people to explain how it happened and listen to this [ __ ] my limbs went down and my mind went p and I remember my heart pounding like crazy and my ears were going stinging and ripple Ripple Ripple yeah we got to lock her ass up got the whole team in disbelief and Tokyo where are you looking now his homeboy turn to explain and in short he just tells them to get a high ass fever and fight through that [ __ ] without popping an ibuprofen That's it man yall some weak ass [ __ ] if you think this is hard your perception of this task as difficult merely realiz the Simplicity of your mind say it again puddle boy negative so this is where the season's main point is getting started the hashira training Arc boring ass Arc not going to lie depression doesn't want anything to do with this and H then with a you don't understand the darkness inside of me scar guy is the first one to call him out on his fake e boy face because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you miss TI Magi over here tries to calm the situation down but she's not that guy [Music] all right too much yapping and we're still on the first episode the worst character is Sally back happy over some little old children he should be locked up since episode one he also finds out about the neso situation which definitely got him Rock Solid but after she calls him inos that's over inos himself has apparently been out there bullshitting with nuko and we goaga Nuka got tan Rose blade all fixed up looking mad sharp I don't know if homeboy will make it though n he's fine G is here as well grumpy as always and Tano and now the hashira training program is finally in motion and somewhat less happy than others they even brought back my gold Tangen to train up the NPCs and with him come six other good things nah but the wives are goed for real look at all that food later you know what we might be cooked against Mand dog this is not the output we want to see right now so the different hashiras are in charge of different training Tangen has stamina Miss boy has movement radish has flexibility worm boy has sword skills scar guy has pure hell and lastly Brock has being a sec [Music] yeah oh a message I wonder what's going on I hope it's nothing serious so he gets a message from the main man himself who is on 2 Hp no Shields by no one surprise water boy is not participating in the hasher training program sitting by his lonely ass probably blasting some Mac Miller or some [ __ ] meanwhile it looks like the demon shy from season 1 finally got sniffed out by this deep ass voice bird just listen to this dude he is not corpse where is yushiro there is no need to worry about him you can hear his footsteps clear as St [Music] a did he just die that is of no importance come join us at the Demon Slayer corpse the one organization that has been hunting you for centuries oh and that boy might be dead I really don't know all right a new day for new [ __ ] guu is still not feeling like participating because his feelings ouchie so tanyo who's still recovering has to go and force this grown ass man out to not be dead weight that's sad for this dude on God ah Miss oan could I ask you a question nah I'm just playing she makes some food to bribe water boy with and with that he's off excuse me toyan I am here hello you are not doing anything for the team please get out here if you don't I'll break your door okay I'll warned you did he just say he was going to break my door this boy too goofy man get him out of this universe anyways they start yapping away or Tano is yapping away this is the most one-sided conversation since I last talked to a girl water boy has some identity crisis going on and tries to get rid of him but homeboy won't give up that easily and does some Next Level stock in the coming days it took him about 4 days until he finally broke and started trauma dumping when I was a young boy I know this man wasn't expecting that so in short the guy I called ugly and got flame for was supposedly the goat of Tomy yokas generation and died in the final selection saving his Sor ass since then he has been carrying around all this trauma but somehow with one sentence from Mr Den over here he just changes his mind like that oh my [ __ ] god character writing goes crazy in this show for real homeboy was reading this whole situation wrong though and challenges him to an eating competition [Music] what shobu did not join the training either and to be honest I forgot the reason why but she looked way locked in at the end of episode Mr flashy is still out there driving straight up torture camps know your money look at him just bullying children who's already down for the count but here comes a man who definitely will say please and thank you after being abused at least looking happy for no apparent reason [ __ ] him anyways he gets to work and we can already see that this is not skill matchmaking doing all this with this uncanny ass happy green on his face what the [ __ ] is wrong with him so he meets up with the baddies for some lunch and he's a way better man than me because I would not be able to hold myself back in front of these tanging a lucky ass dude for real these two random Side characters talking about some night patrols so you know they getting packed up brutally later did you hear about that Drake Kendrick beef dude that was like 2 months ago you slow as hell [ __ ] you then I just tried to make some friendly small talk with your ugly ass what yeah they actually make it out somehow but they know that some goofy [ __ ] is going on because somehow that nasty ass old head got replaced by a new upper rank four now some more training [ __ ] and where did this unit come from where was he when we were fighting the upper ranks he doesn't even need a sword he got that boxing breathing first form catch these mother [ __ ] hands you know I'm putting as much of the wives in this [ __ ] as possible for your horny asses out there so if you don't like this [ __ ] we got a problem okay now we might actually see some real boxing with these two linkoln off on sparing but of course before that happens Tangen wants to bully the that's fortunate a bit more oh where is he where is he oh my God here no here oh my God he's right behind me isn't he bro you good yeah it ain't looking too hot we can't even see this man and he's already winning tyo is even more locked in than he was fing the upper ranks for some reason and tells the remaining to get in line but of course that doesn't work he starts going head to-head with a disabled hashira which gives the other some motivation to actually help but a cut you know damn well they all got their ass beat even Hulk over here looks down in the dumps I swear yall so weak for no reason I've trained you for so long at this point and you can't even land a hit on me I'm disabled for God's sake I park in the disabled lot at Walmart it's like you beating a man in a wheelchair but still lose we are not the main character huh we will die either way without fail we won't be missed me too we will die yeah we are not where did we find such a sorry ass group of people anyways Tano moves on to the next training cuz he actually get [ __ ] done the settle down and the first thing he sees when he arrives is Miss boy absolutely demolishing these poor people both mentally and physically bro is really out there like your life is nothing you serve zero purpose you should kill yourself now like listen to this [ __ ] [ __ ] that's four months in the hospital at least getting disrespected like this by a 14-year-old is actually crazy but he gets all happy when he SE his homeboy yipp they even getting clowned on by his bird this is some diabolical heading going on now so apparently one of the source meths came to the residence permanently to fix up the blades and he's doing a hella good job doing it well how is it it's amazing I ain't going to lie we are so cooked how did this man even get here wide open yelling like a little kid and running with no form whatsoever yeah mishiro gets bored and just leaves don't forget that this man hasn't even hit puberty yet you remember that new upper rank four from before yeah it's that one lady who plays that trash music and her yob seems to be stalk in the hashas to find out some valuable information now we finally get to see some real boxing scarf freak and emo boys already on the yump throwing hay makers when these childing up with them they decide to team up on the kid and he just tells them to bring that [ __ ] on already got OB in shackles and almost catched anemy as well but he managed to dodge that [ __ ] and switch out with his teammate who comes in Full Throttle now we throwing hands so hard we can't even see what's going on but you know they're going crazy this annoying ass bird is still here glazing toy though and almost Cates astray in the process anyways they end up having a nice little chat and now we back to miss boy bullying children again but he doesn't sense enough urgency in their movements so he tells them to bring out their real swords which Got Them All Shook but that doesn't last long because the first man just pieces himself under pressure and tries to start sympathizing with homeboy to let him off the hook we are nothing compared to you Lord tokido I know how hard you train please spare us I have a family I don't give a single [ __ ] about you or your family you serve no purpose and will die by the hands of a unnamed demon bottom dweller wow what a nice man now it's Tano's turn and he's holding his own as usual but Mis boy was too scared of being embarrassed so he just tells him to go on to the next training the other NPC also tries to get out but you know how that ends up get out the car spread your butt cheeks and put your teeth on the curve yeah the rest of the episode they just [ __ ] around throwing paper airplanes I don't even know what this show is about anymore neso is being protected by grandpa so we good though oh my God ain't no way we have to deal with this [ __ ] again Tano of course mashes that dumbass energy and gets Gast led into eating pancakes but it looks like he doesn't even know what that [ __ ] is like this is not a New Concept he really From The Trenches okay bro what the [ __ ] are we doing here Michael jaxson might pull up any second and we are whining and dining I'm done with this [ __ ] bro it's over yeah it's over [ __ ] anyways this training is already on some [ __ ] cuz why do they need to be dressed up like this only man having that [ __ ] on is this man right here looking mad muscular and [ __ ] they start doing some simple exercises which of course are pretty boy Nails no he ready excuse me now miss radish shows them the next exercise and this dude was already Rock Solid from the touch of a woman anyway she de balls him and know homeboy turn I have genuinely never seen him tweaking like this before like he's actually [Applause] petrified I'm looking forward to working with you shut your ugly ass up huh don't you think I've seen what Kano has been writing to me about your pretty little face did well in her training huh you seem to have fun did you piss boy well welcome to [ __ ] hell [ __ ] nah someone needs to shake on this man cuz this must be a crime even back in this time period She looks like the basement on Epstein's Island like using humans as obstacles is [ __ ] the reason we ended up like this is because homeboy saw them as a waste of space and a waste of time so he took matters into his own hands the actual training is to hit the doorstoppers between the people without hesitation or hitting the actual dudes of course not going to lie this is some good training for homie cuz this man is too much of a goody two shoes your M man never seen him struggling this much before snake boy sees right through that though and challenges him to a One V one box fight 180 BX BX BX oh this is really going to sting isn't it bro shut up you first come on go ahead let's go in [ __ ] ready the coming days are very much the same just getting beaten over and over again I'm pretty sure some of the pole Gang has passed out as well at this point the last day he finally locks in and gets high or some [ __ ] cuz he'd be imagining all types of [ __ ] going head-to-head with emo boy and actually managing to push him back and evade his strikes moving beautifully and finally managed to get a hit [Music] boy if you don't get your squiggly diggly even after clearing the training homeboy is still mad at his St his girl you don't have to worry this man does not have it in him and before we move on how the [ __ ] are the rest of the members even going to have a chance to complete this training they ain't even got an opportunity to try he just said yep up you go [ __ ] no he's on to scar freaks training and before even getting there a wild [ __ ] face appears yeah lighting boy has apparently already been in there for a while and it's not looking too good had to sneak out that [ __ ] in a looney tun's ass way after some grabble which ends with senu laid out we're back on the move this might be the first time I can agree with senu cuz this is straight up just multiple charges of attempted murder giving homeboy that business because he doesn't like his face look at him he has never been this wounded before ah gosh dang it my whole body hurts to move I really need to figure out something fast hey big brother wait up huh don't be like this come on do you want to build a snowman if you don't shut your useless fake gangster ass up I'll break you bone by bone Dam his breath stinks he gave genya that I'm not your family talk and even being the only [ __ ] with a gun he couldn't do anything but I don't know if homeboy has some pain Kink or something cuz he just dropped the worst possible information to a Demon Slayer the [ __ ] did you just say this is some intense pressure for someone who for sure doesn't shower anyways he tries to poke his eyes out but Tano came in clutch still managed to Nick him though scar guy is not happy about the situation and even with homeboy talk no yutu he's still pissed off so he gets into a Naruto run post and straight up demolish homie midsection leaving him in the air like some I'm going to show you how great I am great I am but he actually managed to block that [ __ ] kind of and landed a nasty round hos kick right back still on his [ __ ] though but moving hella clean for a inyard man senitsu actually doing what he told for once while getting the [ __ ] beaten out of him meanwhile this have turned into a full on brawl the following day yeah he got a restraining order anyways now the boys link up with the third [ __ ] who's doing some waterfall training and this is The Man Behind all this you just know he's bu different locked in full motion so to complete Brook's training you need to handle the waterfall lift up three big ass logs and push this Boulder one 100 m yeah you got me [ __ ] up if you think I'm doing any of this [ __ ] let's go back to Tanga wives not only are they going to stand under a raging waterfall it's probably around March so the water is cold as a [ __ ] so basically we need to keep chanting something under the waterfall because then they know if they are [ __ ] dead or not and the no SK is not doing too great you know me oh yeah oh no s if you didn't know Brook is the strongest in the Demon Slayer corpse so strong in fact that even in noski acknowledge Him all right we putting this guy down so they continue their training absolutely bullshitting the way through it all until he reaches the last stage to push the immovable object 100 m meanwhile the new upper rank four SoundCloud rapper and musan uploading some devious activity and where the [ __ ] did you get a share it seems like we have checked everywhere but uash shiki's residence find it for me under understood Master he appears to be beating his [ __ ] crazy style all right don't say no more understood Master is it bigger than mine yes master [ __ ] always doing better than me so Tano is out there what was that nah he a freak the [ __ ] legs spread open are you dumb anyways he [ __ ] up his sandal pushing this big ass Rock so he has back to fix it up when he sees free [ __ ] dipping because the tra was too hard you know some people just don't have that dog in them and you can easily see on these fre [ __ ] faces that they have no personality no motion and no host now we get to see homeboy's wife Arc with the nocap being mad greedy as usual and sa boy you're dead bringing the boys to tears is just so [ __ ] good he goes back to do some more training but fails miserably when gya pulls up and he all like [ __ ] you doing oh I'm trying to move this rock it's really difficult I moved it what yeah why is Brock hiding behind that tree now he's back to training and can you stop interrupting me now he's back to training and with the power of plot armor and flashbacks he finally managed to power up enough to start moving it which leaves the boys in absolute shackles and not only that he doesn't stop he just keeps on going oh yeah tyo push B that stone P after some time he finally managed to push sh 100 m and he's actually on his way to the Pearly Gates like he might actually be dead nah big man pulls up and water boards his ass and Praises him like the good little boy he is tan being Tino doesn't accept that though which activates this unskippable cut scene you should already know what we think about flashbacks at this point so to sum it up he was a [ __ ] priest who had all these sh under his protection but after one of them idiots ran into a demon he snitched the location for his own Survival which wiped out all of them except one little yet Brook started beating the [ __ ] out of the demon but when the popo arrived the day after the little girl said that he was the one that killed them all which got him locked up the only reason he's here right now is because the other blind dude saved his ass okay back to the present somehow they put genya in in UK in the same room thinking that would end well while sisu changed his whole flow after receiving a mysterious ass letter first time this boy actually looks locked in he might be able to redeem himself for four seasons of toolery Tano is not done with the training and says out to find water boy who's in a full-blown battle with winf freak they always pull this animation out of their ass like they are going crazy looking mad clean as well yeah they break the source into so white boy pulls out his own certified weapons but homeboy stepped in to save the situation man [ __ ] that little piece of [ __ ] he's always on my ass for no reason I should really beat his ass to make him know his place and that stupid go-getter smile I bet he would look better in a blender and all of a sudden he cashes something and is none other than the eye of upper rank four n is not my lover she's just a girl who I need to become strong buto is not my son I'm sorry I'm going to say it but the aura of this [ __ ] is so intense even LeBron can't [ __ ] with him look like he has hot boxed a whip walking with his DOL and gobana shoes with some of the most intense pressure from an anime villain we have ever seen got so so much presence he made his half dead [ __ ] turn to look at him before he remembered his stupid ass con so you finally made your way here musan jaon it's just Manan oh how long I wanted to see your ugly ass face what does he look like he appears to be what the youngsters would call a [ __ ] boy with a big ass forehead [ __ ] I knew it I see no use in this useless conversation I'm here to kill you Grandpa shut your [ __ ] ass up and listen to me before you kill me that's the least you can do all right my bad our bloodline have dedicated our whole life to killing your sorry ass you see those kids ain't mine you see this wife probably mine what are you talking about come closer come closer you know what what what your ass is grass demon boy what he [ __ ] nukes his whole crib wife and children included the hashiras were absolutely in shock this explosion sequence is actually stupid how detailed it is like I can almost smell the smoke wait to explain some of the backstory between these two his family tree accidentally birthed his ugly ass and got cursed so they all would die at an early age therefore his family became generational haters just to kill this one man M didn't die of course but temporarily cosplayed arming in that one scene somehow his pants also regenerate which is kind of weird but there are enough plot holes already so let's not get into it wah he unfinished [ __ ] they got me again I'm out here getting clipped man this is bad they're going to accuse me of clip forming at this point okay let's just try to absorb Ain't No Way demon shorty comes through and stabs his ass right through his stomach mother is Ming ladies and gentlemen musan tried to do something about it but she is not butching oh yeah bro comes through with his invis potion and starts cooking straight away he winds that thing up like Drake in that one video and obliterate his head run of course that doesn't work as he has attack on tiend that [ __ ] bro is still pushing fery and musan as he uses his demon art which homeboy blocks beautifully now all the hashiras are here ready to work and even with the most powerful sourcen of this generation surrounding him musan still looks in on Tango so much hate in his heart is crazy what are you doing it's Michael Jackson get his ass no one can get their hands out of their ass while Tano is locked in let's go they all come through on some real pure hatred [ __ ] with their top breathing Styles ready to annihilate this pest once and for all and now for the best boss fight in anime history let's [ __ ] go main expansion infinite wearly shaped buildings no party like a diddy party [ __ ] yeah I'm tired of this [ __ ] they all get sucked into M's basement and he tweaking the [ __ ] out in no of the perk G your free floating and this sorry ass excuse thinks he's cold all of a sudden [ __ ] he think is the rest of the hasher US are still useless while Tano actually managed to land on something and Sh some pretentious [ __ ] at Manan I'll I'll kill you m yeah okay cut the cameras that's it I know bro I don't have anything to say thank you for watching
