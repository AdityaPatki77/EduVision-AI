    "summary": "Genshin Impact's pre-Version 5.0 story begins with the Traveler and their sibling's arrival in Teyvat, where they're separated by the Unknown God.  Guided by Paimon, the Traveler journeys through the seven nations, each ruled by an Archon empowered by Celestia.  Visions, granting elemental powers, are bestowed by Celestia, hinting at a potential path to godhood.\n\nThe first nation, Mondstadt, is ruled by the absent Anemo Archon, Barbatos.  The Traveler helps the Knights of Favonius defeat Dvalin, a corrupted dragon, revealing a past cataclysm and the Abyss Order's involvement.  However, the Fatui Harbinger, La Signora, steals Barbatos' Gnosis, a powerful artifact.  Mondstadt's history also reveals a past connection to Natlan, involving a Natlan hero who ascended to Celestia.\n\nNext, the Traveler arrives in Liyue, ruled by the Geo Archon, Rex Lapis.  During the Rite of Descension, Rex Lapis is found dead, and the Traveler is wrongly accused of murder.  The Fatui, seeking the Geo Gnosis, exploit the chaos.  With the help of Zhongli, a seemingly ordinary consultant who is secretly Rex Lapis in disguise, the Traveler helps Liyue navigate the crisis and uncover the Fatui's plot.  The story concludes with the Fatui possessing at least two Gnoses, highlighting the ongoing conflict and the Traveler's quest to find their sibling."
