    "transcript": "data science explained in 10 minutes hi everybody if you're looking to become a full-time data scientist and ai expert from scratch then you are at the right place today i'll explain the basics of data science let's start with the definition of data science first data science is essentially the study of data this interdisciplinary field combines domain expertise programming skills as well as knowledge of statistics and mathematics to extract the most relevant insights from data in this field you apply advanced analytics techniques and scientific concepts to extract meaningful information from data for strategic planning in business decision making and other uses i'll proceed to some elementary aspects of data science now [Music] number one how does data science help business organizations firstly you'll need to understand why the data science profession is touted as the sexiest profession of the 21st century and you need to know why there is such a vast scope for career growth in this profession today data science is the lifeblood of business this field is increasingly critical to business organizations as it presents them with competitive advantages over business rivals this multi-faceted field generates insights that help organizations identify new business opportunities analyze the market increase operational efficiency improve marketing and sales programs and leverage data for business decisions data science plays a vital role in virtually every aspect of business operations and strategies for instance it provides valuable information about customers which in turn will help organizations create successful marketing campaigns and highly targeted advertising to increase product sales data science helps in managing financial risk by detecting fraudulent transactions blocking cyber attacks and countering security threats in it systems data science also helps in preventing equipment breakdowns in manufacturing units and other industrial settings from a functional perspective data science initiatives help organizations to optimize customer service management of supply chains distribution networks and product inventories on a more elementary level when all these business operations run smoothly it results in increased efficiency and reduction in costs data science also enables organizations to create better business plans and strategies as they are equipped with the informed analysis of market trends competition and customer behavior without this accurate analysis of relevant data organizations may miss business opportunities and make questionable decisions data science is also crucial in various areas beyond day-to-day business operations for instance in healthcare the uses of data science include diagnosis of health issues image analysis medical research and treatment planning academic establishments use data science to track student performance and help students to improve their marketability to prospective employers sports teams use data science to analyze player performance and map out game strategies so it's evident that data science touches every business sector you can think of number two the four pillars of data science mastery data scientists come from an assortment of educational and work experience backgrounds but you need to be strong in the following four fundamental areas one business your chosen domain two mathematics including statistics and probability three communication written as well as verbal four computer science specifically software or data architecture and engineering while it is highly desirable to have other skills and expertise as well these four are of utmost importance you may be strong in one or two or even three of these pillars but you may not be equally strong in all four the good news is you can develop your expertise in all four of these pillars remember no unicorn data scientist ever started off as one they started as a beginner data scientist just like you the reason why we emphasize these four pillars is because as a data scientist you will be primarily leveraging existing data sources and creating new ones in the real world workplace you will analyze data and extract meaningful information and present your employer with actionable insights in terms of educational background there is no set path to becoming a data scientist several universities offer data science and analytics specific courses mostly at the postgraduate level but regardless of your academic background you will find the ai sciences courses on thinkific platform immensely helpful in your pursuit of becoming a full-time data scientist all of the 15 ai sciences courses have been created with the sole intention of developing your expertise in these four pillars of data science these courses make it easier for you to master the four pillars regardless of your academic background and level of expertise number three what exactly does a data scientist do as a full-time profession data science is relatively young this field grew out of the statistical analysis and data mining fields the data science journal debuted in the year 2002 this journal was published by the international council for science committee on data for science and technology the title of data scientist first emerged in 2008 since then this field has really taken off although several colleges and universities have been offering data science degrees for close to a decade now there's still an acute shortage of data scientists the term science in data science is synonymous with the scientific method so a data scientist typically combines computer programming skills statistical know-how and real-world sensibilities the way a data scientist does this is through business domain knowledge effective communication and quick results interpretation and utilization of the most relevant statistical techniques data infrastructure programming languages and software packages as a data scientist you will uncover insights that are used to drive key business decisions and these insights are also used to take actions that are intended to achieve business goals the duties of a data scientist usually include preparing data for analysis developing innovative strategies for analyzing data and also exploring and visualizing data as a data scientist you'll also use programming languages such as r and python to build models with data and deploy models into applications the most important point that you need to understand is the most effective and efficient data science work is done in teams hence you will rarely work solo in addition to you the data scientist your team might also include the following specialties 1. a data engineer who cleans and prepares the data and determines how it is accessed two a business analyst who specifies the problem three an application developer who deploys the outputs of the analysis or models into applications and products and four an it architect who looks after the underlying processes and infrastructure number four the data scientists toolbox if you're serious about becoming a data scientist you need to know about the typical tools inside a data scientist's proverbial toolbox this is a quick overview of the essential tools in a data scientist's toolbox computer programming is a large chunk of a data scientist's everyday work therefore you need to be skillful with programming languages such as r python julia java sql and scala but you don't need to be an expert programmer in all these languages it's sufficient to be proficient in python or r data scientists generally use ready-made packages and libraries wherever it's possible for algorithms statistics mathematics modeling and data visualization some of the most popular python based ones include pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib tensorflow and pi torch a data scientist usually uses frameworks and notebooks such as jupyter lab and jupyter for reproducible research and reporting these are really powerful as the data and code can be delivered along with important results so that anyone on the team can perform the same analysis and also build on it if required since big data is all the rage these days you should be able to use the tools and technologies that are closely associated with big data too the most popular examples include spark hive presto hadoop kafka mahout drill and pig you also need to be proficient in assessing and querying the various nosql new sql and rdbms database management systems the most common ones are mongodb hadoop hbase redis snowflake mysql postgres and redshift lastly apis and cloud computing and cloud-based services make up an important component of a data scientist toolbox the top cloud service providers include google cloud compute gcp microsoft azure and amazon web services or aws number five the most in-demand data science careers today data science
