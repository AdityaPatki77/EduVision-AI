{"questions": [{"question": "What is the main topic?", "answer": "The main topic is the history of Earth's formation and evolution."}, {"question": "What are the key points about Earth's early history?", "answer": "Key points include: \n- Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n- It experienced a period of intense volcanic activity (Hadean Eon).\n- A Mars-sized object collided with Earth, forming the Moon.\n- The atmosphere was primarily CO2 and there may have been some water present."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the Hadean Eon?", "answer": "The Hadean Eon represents the first eon of Earth's history. It was a period of intense volcanic activity, with an almost entirely molten surface. This era is largely invisible to us due to the lack of surviving evidence."}, {"question": "How long did it take for Earth to reach its current state?", "answer": "The passage states that 90 million years have passed since the lava hell phase began, and it will take hundreds of millions of years for the Moon to shrink as it orbits further away from Earth. The process of reaching our current state took a very long time."}, {"question": "What is the significance of the asteroid bombardment?", "answer": "The constant heavy asteroid bombardment during this period shaped the early solar system, and impacted Earth's development."}]}
