    "summary": "This video details the One Piece timeline, spanning 5,000 years.  Beginning with the planting of Ohara's Tree of Omniscience, the timeline progresses through key events: the founding of Alabasta (year 1524 pre-main story), the Moon People's migration to Earth (around year 400), Zunesha's birth (around year 500), and the construction of Dressrosa Palace (year 600).  The creation of Devil Fruits and the establishment of the global currency, Berries, likely occurred before the Void Century.\n\nJoy Boy, the first pirate, emerges, befriending Zunesha and the Iron Giant, EMT.  He leaves behind his treasure at Laugh Tale, along with poneglyphs detailing his apology to the Fishmen and a promise of return in 800 years.  A war ensues between Joy Boy and 20 kingdoms, resulting in the ancient kingdom's fall, the Void Century, and the rise of the World Government.  The World Government erases this period from history, hiding the ancient weapons: Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus.\n\nSubsequent events include the birth of giants like Oars (around year 1100), Montblanc Noland's expeditions, EMT's awakening and subsequent containment, the rise and fall of the Giant Warrior Pirates, and the founding of various kingdoms and pirate crews.  The era of Rocks, featuring Whitebeard, Kaido, and Big Mom, culminates in a battle on God Valley.  Gol D. Roger's era follows, leading to his execution and the start of the Great Pirate Era.\n\nThe timeline continues through the actions of the Straw Hats, their encounters with various characters, and the major events of the One Piece story, including the Paramount War, the Dressrosa arc, the Whole Cake Island arc, the Wano arc, and the events on Egghead Island, culminating in the current ongoing storyline.  The video also notes the rise and fall of various figures and organizations, highlighting the complex political landscape and the ongoing struggle for power in the One Piece world."
