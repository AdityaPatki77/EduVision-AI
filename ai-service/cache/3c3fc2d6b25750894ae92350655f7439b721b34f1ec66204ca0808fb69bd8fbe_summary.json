{"summary": " Java a highlevel multi-paradigm programming language famous for its ability to compile to platform independent B code. Powers Enterprise web apps with spring framework Big Data pipelines with Hadoop mobile apps on Android and even things like the controller for NASA's Maestro Mars Rover. Instead of compiling to machine code like C or C++ it compiles to bik code that can run on any operating system without recompiling. If we somehow get to 100,000 likes on this video I'll do a full Java tutorial."}
