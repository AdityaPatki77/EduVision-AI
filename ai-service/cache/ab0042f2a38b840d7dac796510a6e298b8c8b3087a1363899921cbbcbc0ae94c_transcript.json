720 episodes Naruto has a very deep story and excellent characters in this video I will tell you the story of Naruto in detail from start to end now let's go to our video 100,000 years ago the arrival of the otsuki a thousand years ago kagia came to Earth with ishiki utsuki to collect the chakra fruit of the god tree to support the matriarch family of the otsuki clan but someone had to be sacrificed for this tree while the low-ranking kaga had to be sacrificed kagaya acted quickly and betrayed ishiki in the process leaving him to die jigan a passing monk rescued ishiki and gave jigan a Karma seal even though ishiki saw him as a worthless tool later when kaguya arrived on Earth she was found by the inhabitants of the ancestral land and taken to their Emperor tenji kaguya introduced herself as the guardian of the god tree using her mysterious Powers she erased her memories of her encounter with tenji and Blended in with the public as his concubine as she grew closer and closer to the emperor kagiya brought two children to Earth their names were Hamra and hagara but then a border conflict started between the two countries and this turned into war kagio believed that her Godly Powers were needed to prevent these conflicts of humanity without waiting for the osuki clan to eat the fruit from the god tree kaguya ate the fruit in doing so Renee awakened her shangan and made the infamous suomi she also became the only person on the planet with Shakra using her new power kaga single-handedly stopped the war and took control of the Nations after bringing peace she used the infinite suomi on humans to turn them into white zetsu Army to prevent the osuki clan from stealing people's chakras however kaga did not want Humanity to be destroyed so she erased the memories of some genjutsu victims and set them free kaga then distributed chakra to her children making them the first humans born with chakra when kago realized that she had the desire to possess all chakra she devised a plan to absorb their chakra by turning her arrows on her sons then merged with the god tree to force the twins to fight her hagoromo and hamura sealed kaga to the Moon using the six paths chibaku Tini however before kagia was sealed she created the black zetsu and released it into the world hamura then traveled to the Moon to assume leadership of the utsuki clan and protect the remaining pieces of the monster Hagar Romo remained on Earth to spread the chakra to humanity and teach them the concept of ninshu subsequently hogo had children they are ashora and Indra Romo gives chakra to humanity and teaches them to use it for harmonious connection called ninshu his sons Indra and Ashura are completely opposite Indra has power but seeks revenge while Ashura has an optimistic character Indra is further angered when haaro chooses Ashura as the new Sage of the Six Paths Indra leaves with his followers to develop Ninjutsu when haguro grows old he separates the t-tailed nun chakra he distributed this chakra to bews with nine different tals he then placed them in separate temples while this was happening hamura's lineage and the T seon who protected the Earth using Byakugan faced internal conflicts and only toneri Al tsuki's ancestors survived on the moon on Earth Indra has founded the uchia clan Ashura founded the sju clan but Indra was manipulated by black zetsu to obtain renegon and break the seal then a war broke out between Indra UIA Clan and Ashera sju Clans many people died in this war 75 years ago Civil War period during the Civil War era Madara IA was born as the first child of Tajima IA leader of the uchia clan and in parallel Hashi sju the eldest child of busama sju leader of the sju clan was born the following year izuna uchai and tobirama sju were also born in a rare moment when the villages were not at War hashirama met Madara a boy his own age the two quickly developed a friendly rivalry hashirama refused to accept children being sent to the battlefield and dying on the battlefield believing it only increased resentment and deaths between the sju and U after the death of his brothers kawarama and later itama hashirama and his surviving brother Toyama decided to establish a Shinobi system that would end the death of children in battle and bring peace between the singju and uchia Madara like hashirama had lost his brothers in the war together they dreamed of a world where children like them didn't have to fight and their siblings were safe Madara and hashirama didn't know their last names from the day they met but at some point they found out hashirama was a singju and Madara was an Uchiha and they had to kill each other hashirama didn't want to kill his friends so he put the task aside but Madara ended his friendship with hashirama his solution was powerful enough to activate his shangan for years hashirama and Madara continued to face each other on the battlefields hashirama was still unable to kill someone he considered a friend and Madara was unable to resist hashirama's Superior abilities even though mangekyo opened Shang God after a time hashirama and Madara became the leaders of their Clans with hashirama's leadership and unique abilities he surpassed sju Uchiha eventually hashirama convinced Madara to fulfill his childhood dream of bringing the two clans together but war broke BR out again and tobirama severely wounded madara's brother isuna the uchia considered accepting this truce but the sju were unwilling to accept it because he had killed his brother isuna izuna's death LED Madara to open the Eternal mangekyo shingan with this new power he launched a final attack on the sju clan and was quickly defeated instead of killing Madara to end the age of War he said he would kill himself if he stopped the war Madara was moved by hashirama's words and eventually agreed to peace 45 years before present the founding of koha the sju chiha and their Clans came together to form a clan that would not require children to die in battle hashirama and Madara revived their childhood friendship and named The Village Kono hagakure other countries followed Kono hagakure's example and created their own secret Villages hashirama took care of much of The Village's infrastructure using his wood type ability he wanted Madara to be the Hokage the leader and protector of the village but at toyama's insistence the Hokage was elected by a vote of the villagers and hashirama was chosen as Hokage but madara's dreams of Peace were different from Hashi while hashirama planned to cooperate with the newly established Villages Madara wanted to control the peace so that it would never end and wanted the other villages to accept koha's Supremacy as evidenced by his attack on muo and onoki from iwagakure hashirama thought that Madara Uchiha would come when the leader of koha was elected as okag and saw this as the first step to sju Supremacy hashirama wanted Madara to be his advisor so that he could improve his image among the villagers and become the Second Hokage Madara felt it was inevitable that he would lose the Second Hokage to Toyama and he felt that this would end badly for the OA the clay tablet had been in the hands of the OA for generations and when they came to koha they brought it with them however black zetsu was able to obtain someone's renegon to open the Eternal sukui and break the seal so he altered the tablet and wrote the wrong things with careful work Madara was able to decipher the tablet it was written that in Shinobi history the UIA and singju could never make peace and that the sju were evil with this information Madara thought koha was a failed experiment he tried to convince his clan even hashirama but no one cared Madara chose to leave the village he returned to fight hashirama with the ninetail demon Fox under his control they fought to exhaustion and their battle led to the creation of the Valley of the end towards the end of the battle Madara was thought to have the upper hand but hashirama actually managed to kill Madara by tricking him with his wooden clone and stabbing him in the back with a sword but Madara managed to take a bite out of hashirama before dying news of madara's death was covered up and his body kept secret to prevent anyone from finding it but mad Dar was already planning ahead he had planned an Izanagi for some time after his death and by sacrificing his right eye he was able to make this isagi and come back to life after coming back to life Madara left behind a replica of his real body and began to regenerate his wounds with hashirama cells from Hashi raama simultaneously Mito Uzumaki sealed the nine tals into his own body becoming the dread beings jingju Riki during the first shobi world war hashirama organized a KAG Summit with the desire to bring peace at the summit he began distri in tailed beast for balance of power and cooperation however the cooperation was not as simple as hashirama had planned tobirama told the other villagers to pay for the tailed beast they would receive the first kazakage then demanded money and land instead of the tailed beast as unrest began to grow hashirama said that any peace treaty they made would be temporary but would help future Generations form a lasting Union Taki gakar commissioned kakuzu to kill hashirama hashirama defeated kakuzu but other Wars broke out they lived in peace for a while hashirama trained hero in s Toby one of toi Rama's students 34 years before present first Shinobi War although this put an end to the smaller Wars the conflicts of the period began to escalate and hashirama eventually died in battle his successor is Hokage tobirama sju attempted to continue hashirama's Quest for Peace but even his efforts could not stop the start of the first Shinobi World War tobirama would die later during the war killed in battle with the Kaku forces of Kumo gakar however before tobirama died he separated koha and the uchia clan and put them in a more remote location this made the OSHA Clan feel uncomfortable however after toi Rama died one of his disciples heroes in sarutobi became hokagay and after that the first Shinobi war ended 15 years before the present second Shinobi War during this turbulent period of the second Shinobi World War Hanzo confronts the koha forces and manages to kill almost everyone only jiah Tsunade and Orochimaru managed to withstand this attack and the resistance earned them the nickname koha sin they're also students of heroin the Hoka however Tsunade finds Don Kato the man she loved dead in this battle which causes Tsunade to develop a fear of blood meanwhile 10-year-old Kushina Uzumaki finds herself chosen as a surrogate for kurarama which leads to the death of the patient Mito Uzumaki 12 years before the present nagato story in the middle of these Changing Times the old mataa awakens his renegon but he's very old when he awakens and so he gives renegon to nagato when he is very young and unbeknownst to his family sometime later during the second Shinobi World War nagato and his family took refuge in a hut because of the war going on around them one day
