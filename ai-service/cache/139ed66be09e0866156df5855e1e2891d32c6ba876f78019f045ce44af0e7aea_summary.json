    "summary": "Jujutsu Kaisen season one follows Yuji Itadori, a powerful high school student who swallows a cursed finger belonging to the king of curses, Sukuna, to save his friends.  This act makes him a vessel for Sukuna, forcing him to suppress the powerful curse while training at Tokyo Jujutsu High under Gojo Satoru.  He's joined by Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki.\n\nThe season features several intense battles against powerful curses.  Yuji's team faces numerous challenges, including a cursed womb at a detention center, where Yuji is severely injured and Sukuna briefly takes over.  Sukuna's actions lead to Yuji's temporary death, but he's revived.  The team also encounters Mahito, a particularly dangerous curse who transforms humans into monstrous beings, culminating in a devastating battle that results in the death of a key ally, Nanami.\n\nThe Kyoto Sister School Exchange event serves as a major arc, where the Tokyo and Kyoto students compete, revealing hidden strengths and weaknesses within both schools.  This event is ultimately a ruse orchestrated by a larger group of antagonists aiming to seal away Gojo and unleash chaos.  The season ends with the Tokyo students proving their strength, earning a promotion, and setting the stage for the impending Shibuya Incident, foreshadowed by the theft of Sukuna's fingers and the ominous warning of October 31st.  The season concludes with Yuji consuming another of Sukuna's fingers, leaving him and his allies poised for the even greater challenges to come."
