    "transcript": "this is Ichigo Kurosaki and bleach is his story pretty much your average 15 year old kid Ichigo lives in the Japanese town of karakura with his twin sisters Karen and Yuzu and they're loving if overbearing father ishin Ichigo goes to school gets good grades and sometimes gets into fights thanks to his striking orange hair there is one unusual thing about him however he can see ghosts the world of bleach is haunted by Spirits invisible to the normal human eye these ghosts come in different forms from the friendly often timid pluses to the Monstrous malevolent Hollows colossal beast-like creatures who devour other spirits and humans alike one night a mysterious woman clad in a black outfit steps through the wall into ichigo's bedroom this is Rukia kuchki a Shinigami or a god of death surprised Ichigo can see her rookie explains that as Shinigami it's her job to help Spirits pass on to the afterlife to a world called The Soul Society but more on that later that night the Kurosaki household comes under attack a hollow is seeking out Ichigo wanting to devour him Rook here attempts to defend him but suffers a mortal wound in a desperate last-ditch effort to save them both Rukia stabs Ichigo with her Zan puck toe the weapon of a Shinigami and transfers him some of her Shinigami Powers the transfer is a success Ichigo now is Shinigami himself and wielding a colossal blade defeats the hollow unfortunately the transfer of powers worked too well Rukia has been stripped of all her powers leaving her stranded in the human world for the time being so until rookia's powers can return to her Ichigo takes on the role of a substitute Shinigami filling in farukia and defending the residents of karakura town from Hollows including his close friends orahime inue and Sado Chad yasatora one particularly nasty Hollow who was evil in life as well is sent to Hell instead of the Soul Society Ichigo undertakes a variety of missions ranging from capturing a renegade called con to helping Don kanoji a famous TV personality best Hollow in the local hospital but one day Ichigo asks to pause his substitute Shinigami duties it's the anniversary of his mother masaki's death during a trip to the graveyard so the family can pay their yearly respects the Kurosaki sisters are attacked by the foulest hollow of them all Grand Fisher a True Villain and the hollow responsible for attacking and killing masaki so many years ago despite a vicious battle where Ichigo is seriously wounded he gains the upper hand on the hollow and after dealing a critical blow forces Grand Fisher to flee settling into his role ichigo's beliefs are challenged by a boy in his class who do you Ishida a mystical Archer with a vendetta against the Shinigami uriu belongs to a clan called the Quincy who wiped out 200 years ago by the Shinigami uriu baits an army of Hollows to karakura town in order to kill them all but things quickly get out of hand during the appearance of these Hollows ichigo's friends orohime and Chad develop powers and abilities of their own Orihime gains the power of the shun shunrika six fairies born from her hairpieces that can create defensive Shields and restore wounds while Chad wields the right arm of the giant which gives him immense destructive and defensive power Ichigo and uriu put their differences aside and work together to fight a menosgrande a towering Hollow with Ichigo eventually repelling it showcasing unbelievable latent strength everything seems to be working out well for Ichigo and the others but one night two shadowy figures arrive in karakura and they're here to arrest rookia the two figures are high-ranking officers from the soul Society itself Vice Captain renji abarai and Captain biakiyakuchi rukia's older brother Rukia has committed the grave crime of giving a human her Shinigami powers and now the sole Society has issued a warrant for her capture Ichigo tries to save Rukia and momentarily manages to overpower renji but is quickly defeated and incapacitated by biakia the trio of Shinigami leave the boy lying in the rain his life seeping out of him on the soaking wet ground Ichigo awaits his fate except suddenly the rain stops Ichigo is rescued on the brink of death by the mysterious kisuke urahara the owner of the local urahara candy store a shady man with a hidden agenda and historical ties to the soul Society urahara heals Ichigo and takes him under his wing promising to help him not only unlock his own Shinigami Powers but make him strong enough in 10 days to take on the soul society and rescue Rukia from her grisly fate at the same time orohime and Chad are taught to use their own powers by a talking black cat called Mr yoroichi an associate of urahara's while uriu Masters his own Quincy abilities through a series of three trials Ichigo finds himself within his inner World a spiritual place inside every Shinigami Soul where he talks with a strange Man in Black eventually after nearly becoming a hollow at the hands of urahara's brutal tests Ichigo realizes his true Shinigami power and transforms bearing both the zanpukto of his own and a sinister-looking Hollow Mask but we'll get to that a little later as Ichigo continues to battle urahara he also learns the name of izzan pukto and the Ghostly Man in Black zangetsu after continuing their training for a few more days the gang comes together at urihara shop where they prepare for their Journey to the soul Society to dive deep into the heart of the enemy and Save from certain Doom so with Ichigo and the others on their way to the soul Society it seems like now is a good time to explore the Shinigami a bit deeper there was a lot of terminology there after all the soul Society is where all spirits of the Dead are ferried to an afterlife essentially at the center of the Eastern branch of the Soul Society sits the sayrete the city of the Shinigami the soul society's military arm is called the gote 13 and as you might suspect is made up of 13 distinct divisions each one headed by a captain and a Vice Captain who command a number of seated and unseated officers each Shinigami wields their own completely unique zanpaktou a katana imprinted with their soul allowing it to take on a new form when its name is called granting them access to amazing powers in order to save Rukia Ichigo and his friends are going to have to battle their way through the gote 13 and live to tell the tale Ichigo and the others explore load into the soul society and land in the rundown impoverished area outside the sayrete's walls known as the rukongai district no attempts to enter the soul Society but is confronted by the gatekeeper jidanbo although Ichigo successfully defeats him by destroying his axes he doesn't make it far the third divisions Captain gin ichimaru approaches them and uses his zanpakto shikai the first stage of Azan pukto that is activated by calling its name to remove Ichigo from the city itself before the gate comes crashing down in need of a new way in yoruichi takes the team to his old friend kukaku Shiba a fireworks expert and the owner of the kukaku flower crane cannon with which they can blast themselves over the wall and into the sayrete taking kukaku's brother ganju with them they successfully breached the sayrete but the force of the explosion separates them all Ichigo and ganju end up facing off against two members of the fight-loving 11th Division ikaku and yumachika and managed to defeat them before taking a Shinigami medic hanataro hostage hanataro leads each you go and ganji through the canal Network beneath the sayrete until they arrive at the foot of the Sen's IQ the compound rookia is being held in where they're confronted by the Vice Captain of the sixth Division and a Shinigami Ichigo has fought before renji abarai after a bloody battle Ichigo utilizes his training from urahara to finally defeat renji but in a surprising twist renji begs Ichigo to save Rukia from her impending execution as the two of them are childhood friends and Ichigo promises that he will the three of them then Retreat back into the canals where hanataro heals their wounds and Muses over the appearance of a strange hollow-like mask which seemingly manifested to protect Ichigo during the battle with renji at a meeting of the captains the highest ranking officers of the gote 13 gin ichimaru seemingly threatens the captain of the fifth division sosuke Eisen which is overheard by the icy captain of the 10th division toshiro sugaya later geen has apparently made good on

others are confronted by the Monstrous captain of the 11th division Ken patches Iraqi Chad battles kyoraku but is swiftly defeated and knocked unconscious while Ichigo engages Zaraki in a brutal sword fight Zaraki seems Unstoppable but after reaffirming both his respect for zangetsu and realizing that zangetsu will always be by his side and he can utilize his power Ichigo manages to cut Zaraki down ending the battle in a stalemate having continued onwards alone ganju and hanataro reach rukia's cell the black cat yoruichi rescues the dying Ichigo and heals his wounds before revealing her true form that of a female Shinigami All Along yoruichi confiscates The Hollow mask from Ichigo before both of them sense biakya kuchki the captain of the sixth division arriving at rookia's cell byakia dispatches with ganju in a brutal fashion but Ichigo arrives to protect them Ichigo prepares to challenge byakia but yoruichi intervenes and knocks him out escaping from the scene with ichigo's body

more of Gene's scheming and they fight briefly ending with geen's Escape after a last minute intervention by the Vice Captain of the 10th division rangikum Matsumoto geen's childhood friend ichigo's Bankai training continues when suddenly renji discovers their secret location but reveals that he's only there to train himself explaining that Rookie's execution has been moved up to tomorrow

former captain at that kills Grand Fisher in a single hit before discussing the creature with urahara they both believe Eisen is using the stolen hogyoku to transform Hollows into beings called aranka Hollows that have removed the majority of their masks to gain Shinigami powers and become more humanoid Eisen plans on creating an all-powerful army of these creatures with which to crush the world in the same evening a powerless uriu is attacked by a large Hollow and rescued by his own father but you can Ishida the self-proclaimed last Quincy ryuken offers to restore uriu's powers on the condition

have finally returned as Ichigo struggles more and more with the invasive thoughts of this strange being inside him he spirals into a depression before seeking out Shinji and his gang known as the vizards the Shinigami have all been subjected to holification meaning they can access the powers of a hollow by means of their own Hollow Mask once they've conquered the being inside them returning to his inner World once more Ichigo battles this mysterious Hollow who claims to be zangetsu himself after a rigorous training session with the vizards which almost leads Ichigo to transform entirely into a hollow and be completely lost Ichigo emerges in control but not before the inner Hollow threatens to take over his body again should Ichigo ever die at the same time uriu completes his training with his father restoring his Quincy Powers meanwhile the Shinigami deduce eisen's true true objective he wants to gain access to the Royal Palace of the Soul society and murder the soul King himself

captains meet the Iran car head on in battle Eisen summons his top three Espada to his side coyote Stark barragon Louisiana Bell and prepares for war however before the battle takes place we must briefly return to the Past over a hundred years ago the vizards were actually captains and vice captains of the goatee 13. Eisen at this point the vice captain of the fifth division was performing experiments on unwitting residents of Soul Society attempting to perfect holification to see if the barriers between Shinigami and Hollow could truly be broken when kisuke urahara is inducted in as a new captain all the captains and vice captains who would become visards fall victim to eyes and schemes and despite urohara's best attempts to apprehend him Eisen instead succeeds in framing urahara for the experiments with yoruichi's help urahara flees the sole Society with the vizards who prepare for the eventual battle

Bankai but when reinforcements arrive for Eisen in the form of the strange absent-minded Iran car wonderwice and a colossal Hollow called hulia the battle shifts back into eisen's favor as Julia frees Eisen and barragon and harabel are revealed to be unharmed the battle looks lost except suddenly the vizards arrive on the scene hatch again assists soifon in killing barragon while love and Rose are

underway the soldiers of the goatee 13 and the Visas unite to defend Ichigo from Eisen but thanks to eisen's illusory tricks he defeats all of them even forcing toshiro to stab hinomori himself toshiro's rage allows Eisen to get the better of the captains before coming face to face with the Yamamoto Yamamoto unleashes his zanpak toe but the strange old ankar Wonder Weiss is revealed to have been created to counter yamamoto's ancient blade despite this Yamamoto destroys him but the resulting blast takes the captain Commander down Ichigo challenges Eisen himself with Eisen revealing that he has controlled every single action Ichigo has made so far right down to sending Rukia to karakura town that fateful night Eisen also reveals he has embedded the hogyoku within himself in the hopes of becoming a Transcendent being greater than both Shinigami and Hollow ishin arrives shocking Ichigo but the two of them set their questions aside for now Ichigo takes on Gene while his father Jules Eisen as the hogayoku begins to transform eisen's body urahara and yoruichi arrive on the scene as well while geen activates his Bankai against Ichigo Eisen begins to evolve thanks to the hogyoku while Gene tests ichigo's resolve after Eisen defeats ishin urahara and yoruichi he and make their way to the real karakora town ishin takes Ichigo under his wing and together they enter the darn Guy

capable of defeating Eisen at the cost of all of ichigo's Shinigami abilities within his inner world the spirit of tenses angetsu fuses with the mysterious inner Hollow and they battle Ichigo in the real karakura town Eisen begins killing the civilians before trying to kill ichigo's friends but at the 11th hour geen betrays and attempts to assassinate eyes and only to be killed himself as all hope seems lost Ichigo returns at last having successfully learned the final getsuga tent show Ichigo forces Eisen from karakura town and the two battle on the outskirts Eisen continues to evolve transforming into an Eldritch Abomination but Ichigo activates the final getsugatent show becoming getsiger itself and launches a blast like the shroud of night at Eisen mugetsu although Eisen survives he is sealed with a nikido spell and the battle and the war is fine finally over with Eisen sentenced to 20 000 years in prison Ichigo and the others celebrate their Victory however Ichigo begins to rapidly lose his powers and eventually after saying goodbye to Rukia loses the ability to see spirits entirely Seventeen months have passed since eisen's defeat Ichigo no longer able to see ghosts lives an ordinary life with only the memories of his time as a substitute Shinigami he's got a part-time job and he's preparing for the end of school despite his new normal life strange occurrences begin happening Chad hasn't been seen for quite some time and uriu is attacked by a mysterious man lurking near ichigo's House Ichigo himself meets ginjo kugo a smooth talking but untrustworthy figure who offers to help Ichigo restore his Shinigami Powers feeling lost and Powerless at the thought of his friends being injured right under his nose Ichigo agrees to ginjo's proposal ginjo is the head of an organization called execution made up of a group of humans with extraordinary abilities known as fullbringers Chad is also revealed to be a part of their team explaining that he is a fullbringer as well with the help of fullbringers riduka and giriko Ichigo completes the first stage of his training and begins to reawaken his power using his substitute Shinigami badge which remembers all of the battles he's been involved in one evening orahime is ambushed by the man who attacked uriu a bookish individual called tsukushima who strikes orahime with his blade a strange technique which doesn't seem to leave a wound or a mark of any kind increasingly concerned about his friends and worried they're keeping things from him due to his lack of abilities Ichigo pushes to complete his full bring training faster at the same time he's also growing wary of urahara and his dad Thanks to ginjo's urging while orahime remarks to Chad that despite not knowing who tsukushima was for some reason she briefly thought of him as someone she knew from deep within her past growing more and more isolated over time Ichigo presses on with the training battling execution member Jackie before unlocking the next stage of his full bring tsukushima arrives at The Hideout itself and disrupts the training jubiling Ichigo gingo steps in to fight instead and manages to repel sukishima long enough for the last fullbringer in the group Yukio to encase Ichigo within his ability transporting him to a separate Dimension when everyone departs the scene tsukushima slices Chad in the same way he did Orihime within this new dimension Yukio administers the final stage of ichigo's training here he fights skinjo himself ginjo blinds Ichigo and seemingly betrays him threatening to kill orohime and Chad in his rage Ichigo sees a faint outline of ginjou within the darkness before his body explodes with energy ginjo contains it revealing Ichigo has completed his full bring at last and he only acted the villain to force ichigo's development along with the training complete and ichigo's sight restored gingyo reveals Ichigo has begun unto sense ryatsu again and the time has nearly come for his Shinigami powers to be returned to him Ichigo returns home but is horrified to find sukishima there for some reason his sister's carried in and use you see sukishima as a member of their family and when ichigo's friends arrive they too seem to know who sukishima is Ichigo flees as the group tried to get him to accept tsukushima quickly discovering that almost everyone he knows has been affected by tsukushima's full bring book of the end which is revealed to have the ability to allow tsukushima to insert himself into his victim's past as somebody of note ginjo catches up with him and the two of them hide with Ichigo resolving to kill sukishima in order to free his friends and family from his control lured to sukushima's Hideout Ichigo activates his full bringing attempts to fight tsukushima while ginjou battles the rest of execution Chad and Orihime arrive to intercept Ichigo also believing sukushima to be a dear friend as Ichigo is overwhelmed ginjo is cut by sukishima uriu having been healed by orahime arrives on the scene and reveals the terrible truth to Ichigo it wasn't tsukushima who cut him down initially but ginjo having been working with sukishima all along ginjou robs Ichigo of his powers as Ichigo sinks to his knees sobbing with Ichigo at his lowest point everything seems lost when he suddenly stabbed through the back by a glowing sword urahara and ishin arrive on the scene but neither of them is holding the blade instead they've been working with rookia and by extension the sole Society to discover a way of restoring Ichigo Shinigami Powers Rook here returns those Powers two weeks ago and he transforms once again wearing the uniform of a Shinigami while wielding a changed zangetsu Ichigo overpowers ginjou as other Shinigami arrive renji biakia toshiro Kenpachi and ikaku the gote 13 reveal that ginjo is actually the first substitute Shinigami before Ichigo who went rogue and murdered a number of other Shinigami ginjo returns having activated ichigo's full bring before Distributing a portion of ichigo's power to the rest of execution all of whom were in on the ruse the fullbringers transformed their powers upgraded and battles break out despite this most of them are no match for the Shinigami and are quickly defeated tsukushima battles byakia managing to injure him and affect him with the power of His follow bring but byaki's allegiance to Ichigo perseveres and he delivers tsukushima a fatal blow meanwhile Ichigo and uriu battle ginjo who reveals the truth about what it means to be a substitute Shinigami the badge given to them by ukitake is designed to Monitor and restrict them at all times the soul Society has been surveilling Ichigo ever since he began working for them controlling his riyatsu levels without his knowledge and being prepared to kill him without hesitation should he show any sign of insubordination feeling betrayed by ukitake and the sole Society ginjou vanished killing shindigami and stealing their powers before coming across Ichigo who he hoped might be able to share his point of view however In This Moment Ichigo makes a choice he chooses to protect and he chooses to trust the soul Society after everything they've been through Ichigo activates his new Bankai and ginjo does the same in preparation for the final clash with the gote 13 looking on Ichigo locks blades with ginjo 2 substitute Shinigami on different sides of the veil overpowering ginjo Ichigo Cuts him down with one last strike and as ginjo dies he Ponders whether or not Ichigo would have ever found himself in ginjo's position and what he might have done if he had as the sun rises over karakura town execution disperses the members either dead or going their separate ways ichigo's Powers have been returned to him and with sukishima's death his friends and family have been returned to normal Ichigo arrives in the sole Society where he confronts the captains and requests to be allowed to give ginjou an honorable burial shocking the Shinigami but as he stares them down they realize that Defiance of his has always been there and as an individual Ichigo has grown up now as Shinigami once again Ichigo Kurosaki returns to being the protector of karakura town there is Peace at Last however something stirs in the darkness an ancient enemy of the Soul Society thought to have been destroyed some 200 years ago has returned and they're declaring war a final war which will decide the fate of the bleach Universe forever"
