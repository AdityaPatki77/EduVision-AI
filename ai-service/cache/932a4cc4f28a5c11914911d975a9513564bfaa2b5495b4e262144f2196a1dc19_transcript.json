    "transcript": "in season 2 of Jiu-Jitsu kaisen the main story line takes place from 2006 to 2018 and today I'm explaining everything you need to know in around 30 minutes or less to start things off the timeline begins with a flashback to when Goa was only 16 and at this age his skills were nothing compared to the guy we know from season 1 for example team Gojo didn't have a domain expansion he didn't know how to heal with reverse curse technique meaning he also couldn't do curse technique reversal or Hollow purple now despite all that he was still the strongest pupil Jiu-Jitsu High alongside his classmate suguru ghetto unlike goo ghetto came from a regular family of non Sorcerers but by some miracle he was born with arguably the most adaptable curse technique in history the name of this power was curse Spirit manipulation and it gave sugu potential to absorb an infinite number of curses including powerful special grades and then control them like his own personal Army although the technique has some drawbacks that we'll explain later on for now all we need to focus on is the process of absorbing curses according to ghetto each curse tasted like a rag used to clean up vomit but there were two reasons why he was willing to make this sacrifice reason one sugaru believed that in society the strong should protect the weak hence why he wanted to use his ability to protect non Sorcerers reason too even though no one could relate to his experience of eating curses his friendship with Gojo meant that ghetto never really felt alone sadly one day all of this began to fall apart when the students were sent on a mission to rescue this teenage girl in the the world of Jiu-Jitsu Rico Amon had various assassins trying to kill her and to understand why there's a bit of ancient history we have to know at least 1500 years ago but possibly even earlier than that a sorcerer called tangum was born with a technique that made her Immortal the downside to this immortality was that she still grew old like a normal person and eventually that became a problem after 500 years of Aging her technique started evolving her into something not human and this was bad because if the transformation was complete then she might lose control and Destroy Mankind in the process therefore to prevent that from happening once every 500 years tangan would reset the age of her body by merging with someone else these mergers are what have allowed her to stay human for so long but importantly it can't just be done with any random person to merge with Tangen a person needs to have compatible DNA and this rare type of individual is known as a star plasma vessel in 2006 Rico was the vessel of this generation although like I said there were assassins trying to get rid of of her the first group of Assassins was an organization named Q who were trying to change Jiu-Jitsu Society by forcing Tangen to evolve by contrast the second group trying to kill Rico was the time vessel Association who were mainly non Sorcerers that worshiped Tangen to be specific followers of this religion thought that tengen was a God and they didn't want their God to become tainted by merging with a regular human for that reason the group hired an assassin called toi fushiguro whose job was to terminate Rico before the merger could happen and an interesting fact about toi is that his dad used to be the leader of the zening clan but toi himself left the family after suffering from years of abuse from a young age the zenin bullied him due to his lack of talent since he was the only known person on Earth to have no cursed energy generally speaking the top Sorcerers have mountains of cursed energy while even non Sorcerers have tiny amounts so yeah toi was just an embarrassment to the clan however what the zenin failed to appreciate is that in exchange for zero cursed energy toi was blessed with super superum strength and sharp senses that enabled him to see curses these gifts made him incredibly dangerous but to kill Rico he still had to get past the strongest sorcerer team within hours of being given their mission ghetto saved Rico from Q's assassination attempt while Gojo defeated their best soldier and caus the group to break up from here the plan was to safely bring Rico to jiujitsu high but things began to go wrong when she chose to visit her school friends one last time the reason this was even allowed was because tangan gave orders to do anything once since the merger wasn't scheduled to happen for 2 more days now predictably while at school she was targeted by assassins again only this time the killers were recruited by togi as part of his master plan he knew that if Gojo was at full strength then it' be impossible to get close to his Target that's why to reduce Gojo's stamina he offered 30 million yen to anyone who could kill the girl within 2 days The Genius of this plan is that firstly you get a bunch of people fighting for you and you don't even have to pay them since they guaranteed to lose secondly the existence of the bounty itself made Gojo paranoid to the point where he didn't sleep for two nights out of concern for Rico safety this meant by the day of the merger he was exhausted and when the bounty finally expired he thought it was safe to let his guard down that mistake is how toi was able to catch him by surprise in this scene and after a very tactical fight Gojo dies at the same time deep below Jiu-Jitsu High Rico was almost ready to do the merger but at the very last second she was given a Cho as we know being the star plasma vessel is a big sacrifice cuz you're essentially asking a child to give up their whole life so that Tangen gets a new body from the start Gojo and ghetto weren't the biggest fans of this idea and they agreed to support Rico and possibly even fight tangan if she decided not to merge when presented with the option to have a normal life an emotional Rico did choose to go back home however the moment was ruined when toi showed up and killed her yeah this guy is just really good at his job what followed this was an epic battle between between ghetto and the Assassin and during this fight we saw one of the drawbacks of cursed Spirit manipulation for context one reason why toi was such a great Hitman is that he had a one-of-a-kind collection of weapons that could negate curse techniques boost his own strength and cut directly into the soul these tools were all stored inside of a small cursed spirit that he tamed but from ghetto perspective he assumed that he'd be able to absorb it sadly what he didn't know at the time is that in rare cases where a cursed Spirit has a master the curse can only be be absorbed once the master is defeated due to this miscalculation he got ripped apart by togi and the only reason he wasn't killed is cuz if he died all of the curses inside him would be released understandably toi didn't want to deal with that and so he left Jitsu high with Rico's dead body and brought her to the time vessel Association there he received the money they owed him plus a bonus on top but on the way out he was confronted by Gojo as it turns out when Satur was on the verge of death he put everything he had into learning reverse curse technique quick reminder reverse curse technique is when you multiply negative curse energy with more negative energy to create a positive energy that can repair the body and fuel curse techniques with his life on the line Gojo finally realized how to do this allowing him to heal from his injuries and awaken a new level of Jiu-Jitsu this upgrade is how he was able to destroy toi with Hollow purple although before the Assassin died he revealed something interesting for context four years earlier toi's wife gave birth to a son called Megami but she died shortly after he was born her death basically led to toi spiraling out of control and so to make some money he agreed to sell his son to the zening clan the deal was that Megami would be handed to them once his curse technique appears but deep down toi knew it would be an awful place to grow up that's why with the final chance to fix his mistake he told Gojo about the situation hoping he might interfere now switching back to ghetto after regaining Consciousness he also went to the time vessel Association where Rico's murder was being C celebrated by the followers in this moment Gojo was tempted to just wipe out everyone there but it was suguru who convinced him there was no point even though ghetto was equally disgusted by these people killing them would have gone against his belief that sorcerer should protect the weak that said because of everything that happened on this Mission his beliefs and his life would drastically change over the next year for instance now that Gojo had surpassed him by learning reverse curse technique the two friends stopped working as a team instead satu went on missions alone since he didn't need any help leaving ghetto to deal with other less important threats by himself gradually this led to his mental health falling off a cliff given that most days he was just on his own eating curses and he began to question why he was even doing this originally his main aim was to protect non- Sorcerers but from experience he now knew that many of these people didn't deserve it then at the height of his depression suguru had a life-changing conversation with Yuki sukumo back in 2007 Yuki was the most powerful sorcerer besides Gojo and her dream was to create a world with no cursed Spirits if you've seen my video explaining season 1 of jjk you know that Spirits are born from cursed energy that leaks out of normal people therefore Yuki theorized that to stop curses being born you have to somehow remove cursed energy from the world so that everyone becomes like toi or you teach mankind to control curse energy thereby preventing any leaks during this discussion ghetto realized that a third option would just be to exterminate all non Sorcerers and youi even admitted this might be an easier way as a side note something else she revealed was that despite Rico's merger not happening tangan hadn't become a threat to humanity like they feared shortly after this meeting a young Jiu-Jitsu High student called hurra was killed on a mission with nanami narrowly escaping and once again suguru questioned if all this suffering was worth it just to protect non Sorcerers in September of 2007 ghetto then finally snapped massacring an entire Village of non Sorcerers with the exception of two young girls who were able to see curses after this day he raised them like they were his own kids while abandoning any ties that he had to jiujitsu high when confronted about this by Gojo suguru explained that his vision was to build a society where only Sorcerers exist and he knew it was possible because Gojo himself has the potential to do it in other words if ghetto could be as strong as Gojo then it' be pretty easy for him to wipe out non Sorcerers so the fact it can be done is why suguru wanted to give it his best try following this the two friends then went their separate ways with satu eventually going on to cancel the deal that toi made with the zenin instead he made arrangements so that Megami and his stepsister were taken care of as he planned to develop fushiguro into a powerful Ally meanwhile ghetto used Brute Force to take over what remained of the time vessel Association this move gave him access to huge financial resources and for years he gathered followers who shared his beliefs in 2017 ghetto and his minions then took the first step towards erratic ating non Sorcerers and if you want to know how that ended I'd recommend watching my breakdown of the Jiu-Jitsu Kaizen movie for everyone else let's Flash Forward by 10 months to when Gojo sent his students on a mission in case you forgot at the end of season 1 Satur believed there was a traitor at Jiu-Jitsu High given that maho's group clearly had access to inside information after looking into it the prime suspect was identified as mechamaru who was a student that we first met during the Goodwill event back then mechamaru whose real name is kichi muta revealed fed that he lived in constant pain couldn't use his legs and had skin so sensitive that it would sting if light touched it for that reason his real body never leaves his secret base however his technique allows him to communicate through these puppets the mission for megami's class was to ask the real Kikuchi some questions but when they arrived it was clear he'd sent them to a fake location by itself this showed he had something to hide and at mecham maru's actual base he received a visit from ghetto and mahito it turns out that months earlier these three had made a bind in vow which is an unbreakable contract between Sorcerers the deal was that kichi would gather Intel for them using his puppet explaining how the curses knew where and when to find Gojo in season 1 in exchange mahito agreed to fully heal mechamaru which is something only he can do remember because kichi was born with a Heavenly restriction it's not like you can fix him with reverse curse technique otherwise the school could have done it a long time ago mahito is different cuz his technique lets him reshape the soul and with a single touch he turned mechamaru into Peak physical condition now you might be wondering why did they try to kill each other right after this and the answer comes down to kichi himself unlike the other humans who work with mahito kichi was never evil in fact he openly said that he thinks of mahito is scum to him all that mattered was getting healthy so he could finally meet his friends especially miwa meaning The Binding vow was purely business as soon as mahito healed him it meant The Vow was now complete and From This Moment both sides were were free to act how they wanted in an Ideal World this is when mechamaru would have escaped to warn Gojo about the villain's plans but ghetto prevented that by surrounding the whole area in a curtain quick reminder a curtain is a barrier made from cursed energy which can be used to stop people from coming in and also to stop people from escaping ghetto barrier left kichi with no choice but to stay in fight and to make things worse he couldn't call for help since curtains do interfere with signals Now by himself the odds of mechamaru beating a special grade curse and and special grade sorcerer were low in fact ghetto felt so unthreatened that he didn't even bother to fight instead he just let mahito have some fun and to be fair kichi strategies did at least make things interesting however one thing we should never forget is that at any time GTO could have summoned many more special grade curses and it was his decision to hold back and do nothing that made it seem like kichi had a chance in reality he was never going to escape and after mahito killed him he confirmed that the battle looked more more dangerous than it was with mechamaru being dead there was now no one left who could spoil their plans and I'm going to take a quick second to explain what their plan is in season 1 we learned that the goal of mahito group is for curses to replace humans as the dominant life forms on the planet to make that happen they first had to get rid of satu Gojo cuz as long as he's around it's impossible for curses to take over originally Joo didn't believe this which is why he personally tried to kill Gojo himself but after this Beatdown they realized he was Invincible that's why instead of trying to kill satu ghetto proposed that they seal him away to be specific in ghetto possession was an object known as the prison realm that can seal anyone inside as long as you satisfy two conditions that we'll discuss later for now all we need to know is that to make the prison realm work the curses had to create a situation where goo was isolated distracted and couldn't use his full power this is what brings us to shabuya on the night of October 31st when thousands of people were in the area to celebrate Halloween at exactly 7:00 p.m. maho's group put up a massive curtain that trapped these civilians inside and a side effect of the barrier was that phone signals were also blocked now at first people didn't really notice anything was wrong since the barrier was invisible to most non Sorcerers as time went on though more and more civilians realized they couldn't leave and without signal there wasn't a way to call for help then according to this random guy people were told that their only way to escape was to bring Satur rug Gojo to shabuya obviously no one here knows who Gojo is but in order to escape they went up to the edge of the curtain and started calling his name when Jiu-Jitsu High heard about this the higher-ups told sataro to fix the problem himself and at 8:31 p.m. he finally arrived at the scene the nature of this curtain meant that even though civilians were trapped Sorcerers could freely enter and leave as many times as they wanted speaking of sorcerers outside the barrier were four separate teams sent by Jiu-Jitsu HQ whose mission for now was to do nothing moving on 7 minutes after arriving Gojo noticed that the villains had created a new curtain inside of shabuya train station just like the curtain above ground the new barrier also trapped non Sorcerers in particular it trapped them around the train platform this meant that if satu was to go down there he'd be totally surrounded by people from all sides and therefore couldn't use red blue or Hollow purple on top of that he also couldn't use a domain expansion since anyone in his domain would be finished and anyone outside his domain would get crushed in between his barrier and the barrier that surrounds the train platform in other words this new curtain was clearly a trap to limit Gojo's power and even though he knew this he still went down there to protect the civilians at 8:40 p.m. he was then confronted by jogo Hanami and choso who began wiping out non Sorcerers right in front of him the purpose of them doing this was to create a big distraction as they wanted all of satar's focus to be on saving lives and fighting curses as long as they could keep that up for at least 20 minutes then ghetto promised them he'd handle everything else unfortunately over half an hour later ghetto still hadn't shown up and by this point Gojo had crushed Hanami to death at the same time Drogo was incredibly stressed out and he only managed to survive by running away and hiding in the crowd the reason ghetto hadn't arrived yet is that he felt like sat was still too relaxed but this began to change when a train pulled up to the platform on this train was mahito and a thousand transfigured humans who were all normal people that were turned into monsters by his technique in the chaos that followed dozens of non Sorcerers were slaughtered by the transfigured humans putting goo in a tricky situation on one hand he could activate his domain expansion which would allow him to easily kill mahito Drogo and all of the transfigured humans however the downside is that it had sacrifice all of the civilians around him which is something Gojo wasn't prepared to do this is why satu was forced to get creative and for the first time ever he expanded his domain for only 0.2 seconds as we know usually infinite void floods the brain with unlimited information but since the domain was so quick the info sent to people's brains was only around 6 months worth this was enough to paralyze every human without giving them permanent damage but Gojo believed that the curses might wake up at any time therefore rather than getting into a fight with them he decided to put all of his efforts into destroying the transfigured humans for 5 minutes straight Gojo then went on a rampage as he killed roughly three or four transfigured humans per second understandably after doing all of that I don't think anyone could say he was relaxed making this the perfect time for GTO to use the prison realm I mentioned earlier that this object has two conditions to work which are one the target has to be within 4 MERS of the prison realm and two the target has to stay there for a minute or to put it another way 60 seconds worth of information has to flow into the target's brain that's why immediately after throwing the prism realm near Gojo ghetto then finally made his appearance remember the last time these two saw each other was nearly a year earlier when saturo killed him during the events of the jjk movie that's why to see ghetto now just standing here was a massive shock and more than that it caused years worth of memories to flow through Gojo's mind this amount of memories easily surpassed the one minute rule for the prison realm and just like that satu was trapped by this special grade object interestingly though just before he was sealed we learned some crucial information about how GTO was still around it turns out that after Gojo had killed his best friend he didn't give the body to shoko who's the doctor at Jiu-Jitsu high back in 2006 shoko was their classmate at the school so it's possible out of compassion for her he didn't want her to deal with zuru's corpse that's just one Theory I mean another theory is that he didn't want ghetto to be dissected but the point is that ghetto body was never cremated this gave an opening for someone else to steal the body and what's crazy is that we already knew about the person who did it if you saw my video explaining the first season then you'll remember a sorcerer called noruto shik who was the mad scientist that created the half human half curse hybrids one of this scientist curse techniques was the ability to take over another person's body by literally switching brains by switching places with ghetto narutoshi gained the ability to use cursed Spirit manipulation which was essential for his own secret plans now while all of this was going on one of the four sorcerer teams was already on their way to Gojo's location this team consisted of the grade one sorcerer May her younger brother we Wei and also Yuji was third Wheeling unlike the other teams who were told to do nothing May's team was already busy dealing with curses and transfigured humans at a place called Mai Shrine station Mai Shrine station is just one stop away from shabuya and it's where mahito was before he hopped on the Train full of transfigured humans since then May's team had been running in that same direction but when goo was sealed Yuji was suddenly contacted by mechamaru by combining technology with jiujitsu kukich wrote a program before his death that would only activate if Gojo was sealed the end result was these AI like robots that contained his memories and for a limited time they were able to talk after convincing ma team that he was actually on their side mechamaru revealed that there was now a new curtain surrounding shabuya station importantly this new barrier stopped all Sorcerers from getting in meaning it was impossible for May's team to reach Gojo for that reason Yuji headed back up to the surface as his mission was to destroy this new curtain while also Gathering allies meanwhile inside of shabuya station the villains had a polite disagreement over what they should do next from joo's point of view to create a world where curses are on top it was necessary to bring sua back to life the general idea was that suca is so evil and so chaotic that if he took control of Yuji it could be the end of modern Civilization by contrast mahito and choso both wanted to kill Yuji for their own personal reasons in mjo's case he believed that with or without the curses is still strong enough to overthrow Humanity therefore it doesn't really matter if it Dory lives or dies and following their previous encounter miito just really wanted to kill him meanwhile in Choo's case he wanted to kill Yuji to avenge his brothers who were finished off last season by Gojo students after failing to agree the curses each ran off to find itadori themselves and whoever found him first would get to decide his fate speaking of Yuji by now he teamed up with Eno who's a grade two Sorcerer And megany to take down the the curtain that blocked Sorcerers for context the source of this curtain was these three talismans which were being protected by granny ogami and Juro aaka back in the 80s these two used Jiu-Jitsu to enjoy successful careers as criminals but everything went downhill for them after Gojo was born as the strongest sorcerer by far his existence forced people like this to lie low as they knew they could never stand up to him that's why they partnered with ghetto AKA Naruto Shamo cuz by sealing goo away it had allow them to freely act as criminals once once again that said thanks to megami's high battle IQ he and Yuji were able to beat jro despite his tricky curse technique in the process the final talismans were now destroyed and at 10:04 p.m. the curtain blocking Sorcerers came down now this should have been a great moment but unfortunately it got overshadowed by Eno almost dying to cut a long story short granny ogami's technique is one that gives her or someone else the option to shape shift into another person crucially though that other person has to be dead and in this case aami transformed her grandson into toi zenin this gave her grandson all of toi's physical attributes and within seconds he pulverized Eno and threw him off a building with Eno being down that forced the sorcerers to kind of rethink their next move with Megami leaving to get Eno some help while Yuji headed to shabuya station alone what's unlucky is the second he arrived choso was right there instantly beginning their fight to the death when it comes to choso his curse technique is blood manipulation which you might have noticed is the exact same as nuto from the Kyoto School however the main difference between them is that because Choo is half human and half cursed Spirit he doesn't run out of blood as long as there's cursed energy in his system he can generate blood forever meaning his attacks can be more adventurous than narutoshi on top of that he's just the more naturally talented Sorcerer And throughout his fight with itadori he quickly adapted and countered yuji's tactics after knocking him unconscious choso had the chance to then kill itadori but at the last moment he felt something a side effect of his technique is that he can immediately sense when his brothers have died and with Yuji on death's door choso had that exact same sensation by default this means that somehow someway itadori is his younger brother but in this moment he didn't know how to make sense of that that's why he just kind of ran away screaming and as he left the area yuji's body was found by mimo and nanako these are the twin Sorcerers who were raised by ghetto but before we get into why they're here let's switch over to Nomi right now his intention was to reach the platform Gojo was sealed cuz thanks to mechamaru they knew the prison realm was still there tagging along with nanami was Maki and Nao zenin who great one Sorcerer And the current head of the zening clan as head of the family he was the one who made the deal to buy Megami so as you can imagine he's not the biggest fan of Gojo despite that he was still with them as they went to go save him but on the way there the group encountered a special grade curse out of the four cursed Spirits in maho's group dagun was easily the weakest but in this scene it was his hatred of humans and his anger at haram's death that helped him to evolve into his true form like this he was strong enough to take them on by himself but the sorcerers worked hard to prevent him opening his domain in particular now Beto's projection sorcery caused a lot of trouble and it's worth taking a second to explain how this works when activated nowo has to think of 24 unique movements in his mind and then his technique makes it all happen within a single second likewise when he touches an opponent they also have to think of 24 unique movements and if those movements aren't performed the victim gets trapped inside a frame for 1 second instead anyway after a big struggle Dagon does eventually open his domain however things kind of go off script when Megami shows up to open his as we know when two domains are open at the same time they fight for control until the strongest domain takes over in this situation it's clear that dagon's domain was more refined but Megami wasn't actually trying to win instead he only opened his domain to create this hole at the edge of dagon's barrier giving the sorcerers a way to ES escape the problem though is that he couldn't maintain the hole for very long and before they could leave toi suddenly entered for context when Granny ogami used her technique her grandson was only meant to inherit toi's appearance and physical strength this was supposed to continue until her grandson had no cursed energy left but the issue is that toi's body never had any to begin with consequently the normal rules of her technique didn't apply leading to a few glitches the first glitch was that her grandson's Soul disappeared as it got over WR by the pure instincts of toi's body essentially this meant he became a Mindless killing machine that simply wanted to fight the strongest person around the second glitch is that there was no time limit due to there being no cursed energy involved and in theory he could keep fighting Forever at least until someone beats him with that explain the ghost of toi entered dagon's domain and with a small assist from naito he casually finished off this special grade curse following that his attention immediately turned to Megami not because it's his son but because fushi shuro was the next strongest person to fight by this point nanami and naito were heavily injured and so they got ignored as toi brought Megami outside the station at the same time Joo showed up right after they left and as revenge for what happened to Dagon he cooked Mari and both of the grade one Sorcerers alive in fact in this scene it looked like he planned to burn naito for a second time but before that could happen he felt suk's presence to be specific he actually sent suk's finger and that's because Mino and nanako had just fed one to Yuji their motivation in doing this was to ask suca for a favor as they needed someone on his level to kill the fake ghetto him being dead would allow them to get their Master's body back since they never really agreed with it being used in this way now within seconds of feeding Yuji Joo then appeared and he came armed with 10 of suk's fingers many of these fingers were the ones they stole from Jiu-Jitsu high and by giving all of them to Yuji at once the king of curses was able to gain temporary control one of the first things he did was to slice up mimo and and nanako for trying to negotiate but with Joo he had a lot more patience this is because Joo didn't ask him to do anything rather he simply suggested the suca could take permanent control of Yuji by making a binding vow crucially what Joo wasn't aware of is that last season these two already made a binding vow that would allow Suk to take over when he felt the time was right for that reason he wasn't interested in joo's proposal but to show his appreciation for the fingers he offered the Cur Spirit a deal the agreement was that that if Joo could land a single hit on sua then he'd help them Massacre every human in shabuya except for one What followed this was equal to a natural disaster as Joo literally melted and tore apart the city trying to land a hit during this Carnage he used every move at his disposal except his domain cuz after losing to Gojo last time he basically had PTSD that said nothing he did this time was enough to hit suca and when the king of curses whipped out his own Flames that was pretty much game over this fight is an aspect of suk's technique not explained in season 2 but based on what he said we know it's a power he's obviously used in the past that he assumed was well known by Sorcerers after using his Flames to burn joogo to a crisp sukuna then sensed there was something wrong with Megami to understand why let's flash back to his fight with toi as he hunted his only child across shabuya it's worth pointing out that because toi was such an absent father when he was alive Megami didn't recognize him and likewise this glitched out version of toi also didn't recognize his son however in the end after nearly killing meami several times toi's ghost finally made the connection and he was actually happy to find out that his son didn't join the zening clan following that he offed himself to prevent any more violence but as Megami left the area he was ambushed by haruta quick reminder haruta is a longtime member of maho's group and a person who exclusively likes to fight weaker opponents earlier that same night he attacked kugisaki aii and other minor characters but was was beat to a pulp when an actual grade one sorcerer showed up having woken up from that Megami was his first victim and considering what he went through you know with opening his domain and fighting toi he just didn't have the strength to fight back at the same time fushiguro didn't want to just die for nothing and so he decided to at least take harut down with him as we know megami's curse technique gives him access to 10 shikami but in order to control them they first have to be tamed in a ritual throughout history mahaga is the one shikami that's never been tamed by F anyone and that's because it has the ability to adapt to anything the only way to kill this monster is to destroy it with an attack it's never seen and by starting the ritual with haruta nearby it forced him to also fight this thing now what sua sensed was mahara being summoned but by the time he arrived there megamy had already been killed that said due to the nature of this ritual his death was put on hold until the ritual was over and the way it works is that the ritual isn't over until either haruta dies or mahara dies therefore to save figura for his own plans sua had to keep haruta alive heal Megami with reverse curse technique you know bring him slightly back to life and then kill the unkillable shikami of course being the king of curses that's exactly what he ended up doing cuz by the time mahara adapted to his slashes sua destroyed it in one shot with his Flames by the end of this fight a huge chunk of shabuya had already been torn apart by his domain so when you factor in the Flames as well hundreds if not thousands of civilians must have died following this Rampage suca then took meami to shoko who was healing Sorcerers nearby and at 11:14 p.m. a traumatized Yuji then regains control in this scene he literally throws up thinking about everyone killed by sua but he does decide to keep on fighting just because he didn't want this to be his only contribution now what Yugi didn't know is that 5 minutes earlier at 11:09 p.m. Toto arrived in shabuya along with n from the Kyoto School unlike literally everyone else these two made it to the area where Gojo was sealed but by the time they got there the prison realm was long gone for that reason their mission changed from saving Gojo to helping their allies and over 10 minutes later they found itadori by this point Yuji had already lost the will to fight as miito had done pretty much everything in his power to crush his soul in particular the curse finished off nanomi right in front of him used random civilians in disgusting ways and then worst of all killed kugisaki with his technique all of this combined led to Yuji having a mental breakdown but it was Toto's arrival that changed everything as Nita took kugisaki away with the promise that she has a non z% chance of surviving it was Toto Who convinced Yuji to carry on and his technique was so disorienting that it arguably played either the biggest or second biggest part in their Victory despite maho's obvious talent and his ability to learn and grow faster than any curse it was his weariness of too's technique that gave Yuji the opening to defeat him with black flash it should be pointed out that during the fight Toto lost his hand and therefore couldn't use his technique but it didn't matter since he was still able to convince mahito that the technique would still work after taking this hit mahito had nothing left to defend himself but before itadori could end things the fake ghetto then showed up from the start this guy had always wanted goo out the way but for a different reason than the rest of the group from his point of view the existence of cursed energy has potential to create something other than just Sorcerers and cursed Spirits a century ago noroshi tested that theory when he created the half curs half human hybrids but sadly choso and his brothers didn't live up to expectations in his words everything he created was limited by his own potential and so the solution is to create such a chaotic situation that even he can't control it doing this could lead to the birth of a new type of human but to create this chaos in the first place he first had to absorb mahito thanks to Yuji beating him up this was incredibly easy and with the curse under his control fake ghetto then combined him with a bunch of other curs Spirits this move is known as a maximum technique and in the case of ghetto it's called Uzumaki and the main benefit is that when you do this with a curse of maho's level the user temporarily gains that curses technique with the ability to change people's Souls noruto she used it in a way that mahito never could for context we know that Tangen has been alive for at least 1500 years and during that time she's created several large barriers made from cursed energy these barriers have various jobs such as hiding the location of jiujitsu high and strengthening the curtains of other sorcerers in this scene what narutoshi does is he hijacks one of Tan's barriers meaning that anyone inside the space can be affected by maho's technique with this power he targeted two specific types of non Sorcerers the first type were people like jume who were people born with curse techniques but without the body or the brain to use them for these people noroshi rewire their brains to turn them into real Sorcerers just like what mahito did in the first season the second type of non sorcerer was a lot different as it's people who've been forced to eat cursed objects in particular noroshi revealed that for the last a thousand years he's been secretly making deals with ancient Sorcerers when these ancient Sorcerers died their souls were then stored inside of cursed objects just like suk's finger and the fake ghetto has been feeding those objects to innocent people one of these victims was megami's stepsister sumiki but unlike Yuji her body wasn't strong enough to be a vessel to fix this noroshi used mahito her technique meaning that now suiki and people like her will be in a similar situation to itadori now as if all of that wasn't enough the fake ghetto then confirmed he has plans to make all of these new Sorcerers kill each other to increase their understanding of cursed energy importantly he doesn't reveal how he's forcing everyone to fight to the death but the implication is that by making everyone have these battles it'll lead to some kind of evolution for Humanity moving on the fake ghetto then finally leaves shabuya after giving his big spee but as he does this he releases at least 10 million cursed Spirits not only did this allow him to escape with the prism realm without much trouble but it forced the sorcerers and the government to put all their focus on helping civilians in fact in the anime we see some unknown lowlevel politicians debating how to react as the curses cause mass chaos in every corner of Tokyo during this chaos millions of people were evacuated and the main job of the sorcerers was to protect those civilians while dealing with as many curses as possible on top of that to explain the need for the evacuation in the first place the existence of cursed Spirits was made public for the first time although the government doesn't exactly tell the whole truth the story that the evacuees were told was that cursed Spirits only appear in Tokyo and this was a strategy so that all of people's negative emotions and their negative cursed energy it would be drawn to this one city rather than spreading across the whole country naturally the destruction of Tokyo also had a bad impact for Japan's economy with May selling off all of her Japanese assets using her brother's technique they were able to escape the country a lot earlier after coming dangerously close to being killed by the fake ghetto finally within Jiu-Jitsu Society itself the hierarchs made five important declarations with ghetto seemingly being alive the first Declaration was that his death penalty was reinstated back in 2007 he was originally given the death penalty but obviously Gojo chose not to kill him and Yuki kind of just does her own thing and doesn't follow orders from jiujitsu high therefore there wasn't really anyone else who could kill him and so he was able to operate for 10 years just doing his own thing the second Declaration was that goo is an accomplice to everything that happened in shabuya and not only is he expelled from Jiu-Jitsu Society but any attempt to free him is a crime to put it simply this rule was only made because the hups were sick of him since he frequently went against their wishes interfered with politics and saved whoever he wanted by them making it appear that he was somehow responsible for shabuya the higher-ups would basically trying to preserve their own power even if it meant Sorcerers losing their greatest weapon anyhow the third Declaration was that principal Yaga was sentenced to death and this makes sense when you consider that he was the teacher to the two Sorcerers currently being painted as villains lastly the fourth and fifth declarations were that with Gojo being gone Yuji is now set to be executed immediately and UTA aotu is his executioner I'm sure most of you watching know who this is but just in case you might not otu is a special grade sourcer who was the protagonist of the jjk movie on screen now should be a direct link to my review of that so please check it out if you're interested and for everyone else thank you so much for watching this is my first video of the year so I'd really appreciate any comments likes and subscriptions as I'm trying to hit 500k Subs in 2025 until the next one peace out"
