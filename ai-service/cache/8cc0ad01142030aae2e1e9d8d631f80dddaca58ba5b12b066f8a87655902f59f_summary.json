    "summary": "Bleach follows Ichigo Kurosaki, a teenager who can see ghosts.  His life changes when Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper (Shinigami), transfers her powers to him to fight a Hollow, a malevolent spirit.  This leaves Rukia powerless, forcing Ichigo to become a Substitute Soul Reaper, protecting Karakura Town from Hollows with his friends Orihime and Chad, who also develop powers.  Ichigo's duties are interrupted by the reappearance of a powerful Hollow responsible for his mother's death, which he defeats.  A conflict arises with Uryu Ishida, a Quincy (a spirit-hunting clan), leading to a large Hollow attack.\n\nRukia's actions are deemed a crime by Soul Society, resulting in her arrest.  Ichigo, aided by Kisuke Urahara, trains intensely to rescue her, mastering his powers and Bankai (his Zanpakuto's ultimate form).  In Soul Society, Ichigo and his friends battle numerous Shinigami, uncovering a conspiracy involving Captain Sosuke Aizen, who faked his death and orchestrated Rukia's execution.  Aizen's betrayal and the use of the Hogyoku, a powerful artifact, lead to a large-scale war.  Ichigo defeats Aizen, but loses his powers temporarily.\n\nLater, Ichigo regains his powers through Fullbring, a human-based power system, after encountering Ginjo Kugo and the Xcution organization.  A new threat emerges, involving Tsukishima, whose ability alters memories.  Ichigo confronts this, ultimately discovering a betrayal by Ginjo, who was the first Substitute Soul Reaper.  Ichigo's powers are restored with Soul Society's help, and he defeats Ginjo.  Peace returns, but an ancient enemy resurfaces, foreshadowing a final, devastating war."
