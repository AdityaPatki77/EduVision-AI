goods group recorded a massive 79 billion in annual revenue in 2021 the cheapest thing youll find in one of these stores is a bottle of perfume or a wallet which costs a minimum of 200 USD and on the other end of the spectrum one of the most expensive items you can buy at the LV store is an airplane handbag which will set you back 40,000 USD for the bag of load I wondered if while being on my mission today I would only be meeting billionaires from royal families or would I be meeting normal people just like you and I it was now time to find out all right you guys we have just arrived outside the Louis Baton store here in Sydney Australia todays Mission I think is to really see what sorts of people shop with these types of stores and what did you buy today uh the belt how can you

out there that want to become an entrepreneur like you if you like just get that guys killing it f out feel like a peasant right now what you buy a bag for my mom how much did you spend today about three 3,000 yeah what do you do for work I have five jobs five jobs yeah is that how you can afford designer yeah pretty much thats interesting thats very interesting you dont see that every day you dont have to be an entrepreneur necessarily or do something spectacular to be able to you know have a high level of income or wealth what I found interesting is that basically no one I interviewed seemed like multi-millionaires but rather normal people just like us so I decided to go into the lb store and see if I could find someone that actually fits the Louis Vuitton stereotype will these suit me can I try these on you know what they say about small feet big socks no I dont like these anymore Crush my ego and then this happened excuse me mate quick question do you shop you very often at the Louis Vuitton store n not really man probably once a year yeah what are you do for living predominantly Im in a restaurant game but Im an entrepreneur man I import export all sorts of food good stuff would you say you have like a few little designer items at your place as well oh yeah Im sure I do whats your main company called the company Im known face wise you probably know it its called ret R yeah rash restaurants yeah oh wait you like the CEO yeah I see Im the found no way cuz I I looked at you when I saw the bid and I was like wait I swear Ive seen this guy before somewhere ah respect bro thats M I realized I had stumbled across the perfect person for this video as Ramy invited me to check out one of his Waterfront prop in the CBD of cityne so this is uh this is your crib all right mad how can we go up to Music yours all right so o it became a real personal proe look this this is sick wow oh yes all righty thank you so much Mr Ramy for showing us a bit into your life so tell us how you sort of got to this position where you became a very successful business owner and yeah whats your sort of story oh mate Drive hard work coming from a poor background we lived in a Housing Commission area so for us just to have joggers was like a big deal I guess all those little things you know going with your parents shopping watching them not being able to afford to buy you things I think really dve me and I just wanted for my family to afford things that was my first drive I got to live in Lebanon for 6 years when I come to Australia I got to see the Poor Side because we come with nothing so I got to see how how it is to live below the poverty line but I also understood it from the Middle East from Lebanon which was again another living in poverty and in War I put it down to you know just seeing how tough people did it and I just did I just wanted more for my family and for myself I guess and how much do you think rash is worth in 23 honestly its too hard of a question mate if you ask me what its worth I would say hundreds of millions you know and then if youre more realistic I really dont know M its nothing I focus on for me its not about what my wealth is I guess this is a good lesson for people out there I guess its never about how much your wealth cuz your wealth or what your worth is what is your lifestyle like now you know where are you mentally where are you financially today where are you familywise thats how you judge wealth we dont judge wealth by a number in my mind anyway thats not a real measure of an entrepreneur and what advice would you give to young entrepreneurs hoping to achieve what youve achieved stay focused on what you want to do down loose Focus dont get distracted because thats the biggest thing we always get distractions in our life and I think thats what throws all entrepreneurs off just focus on what you want and thats it go for it love it man thank you so much for your time really appreciate thanks Ramy was a great example of a person from a migrant background that created wealth for himself and also a legacy he proves to all of us that hard work does be Talent and that anyone out there can achieve their goals of becoming financially free from interviewing dozens of people outside the LV store today I realized that there isnt just one type of person that shops here from the Instagram model that spent a casual 10,000 on clothes to the girl that has five jobs there are different motives for all of us the lb store has a bit of something for everyone and for me personally Im just going to stick to only shopping here when I get videos that hit 10 million views so do me a favor and make this video a blow up so I can go and buy that ridiculous 40,000 a find handbag for absolutely no reason thanks"}
