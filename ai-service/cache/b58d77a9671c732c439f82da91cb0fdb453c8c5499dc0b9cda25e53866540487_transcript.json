    "transcript": "can't serve on this team anymore given that my son is a prime suspect it's a conflict of interest yes that's true so will you send me to solitary confinement not exactly you Mr Yagami are sentenced to spend every moment of the day with your wife until further noticed later Shady baby SM [Music] ah yes High School the generic setting for all television shows whose target age is 13 through 24 anyway this is Light Yagami typical high school guy he's got the best grades in the class all the hoes what could go wrong in his life anyway he's walking back from class and he stumbles upon this book called The Death Note and he picks it up and takes it home of course he thinks it's a hoax so he does it once to just be safe but then it's actually real nah but you can never be too safe right so he does it again this time on some random horn ball but sure enough it works and then he gets paid a visit by this Shinigami called ryuk and he was basically like all right this is the Death Note any human whose name is written in the death note will die you can write the cause of death but if you don't they just die have a heart attack in 40 seconds it doesn't work on infants and todders and on top of that I think I just gave the death note to a serial killer oops so light's been cooking people for a few days now and it's gotten the attention of the police department who decided to have a meeting trying to figure out what is going on one guy was actually spot on but they hit him with the crazy allegations they wasn't taking [ __ ] he said serious but then this LA Noir looking ass [ __ ] walked out and put in that call and it was answered by some dude named L and look at this Elite level glazing right here bro they was calling him the Michael Jordan of detectiving on some if the Martians have the death being pointed at Earth you better solve it I want L type [ __ ] but now he pretty much just said hey give me a pack of four Locos a copy of slime season 3 and I'mma have him try not to drop this hope in seven to 10 business days meanwhile light was trying to cook up a way to hide the death no from his family and the police if he ever got interrogated by them and as it turned out he's actually gained quite a name for himself as the general public is finding out about his actions he's managed to earn the name kah and as he's chopping it up with ryuk the police organization decides to go on live and hello there my name is Lind L Taylor otherwise known as L and I am in charge of the international police task force as of right now we're going to focus on trying to capture the person responsible for all these deaths they called by heart dumbass [ __ ] should have left the [ __ ] name tag off the table well seems like it worked hello there Kira I am the The Real L and this was a test to try and lure you out and it seems like it worked now not only do I know where you live I also know that you don't have to be there to do the killing I'm on your ass [ __ ] bye anyway like a few days have passed and now they're in the War Room trying to figure out who K is and L smart ass was like check the times of when folks is getting dropped it's between 400 p.m. and midnight right so why not the other hours of the day what happens during the other hours of the day school coincidence I think not and not only did he figure that out he managed to figure out his whole motivation for this [ __ ] he's only been a character for two episodes man he might be the smartest in the game since Einstein but as it turns out the head of the police force is none other than lights father and since his computer password is probably password or some [ __ ] like that light was able to get access to the police info and he figured out that they deduced the culprit to more than likely being a student how is like going to respond to this well he decided to just make their call causes of death heart attacks so that he could specify the time so instead of after school he did that [ __ ] every hour folks was dropping like flies meanwhile he was hitting headers like earling Holland but L was already a step ahead of him he realized that the timing of the killing switched up right after they suspected a student he realized that obviously Kira has access to the police files but wait hold on light purposely set it up that way so L would interrogate the police and the police would in turn do the exact same which would result in L's name becoming public anyway after that L has all the information of all the families and then has light tail to start off seeing that he is the son of the chief mean ruk was trying to get light to sign the 360 deal for his eyes but light was like nah I'm good I'm trying to live the [ __ ] anyway he decided to spend some more time testing the limits of the death note so he started knocking off people in random he had one dude draw a pentagram another person write a letter and then another guy just ran to the bathroom and [ __ ] himself to death or some [ __ ] like that I don't know he had the other three guys do some random [ __ ] like for example one guy was supposed to die in France but obviously he can't you know cuz he's in jail so he just had a heart attack but in doing that he peeped that the deaths of the people can only be manipulated depending on location and if it's something like they have to do then it also depends on what the victim actually knows so he decides to cook up a plan to sleep the dude that was trailing so he called up one of his hoes for a date knowing the guy would follow him but seeing as nothing suspicious was happening he decided to conclude his investigation of light so he hopped on the bus with him and witnessed the equivalent of light successfully faking his Tas but then randoms ons and starts twe the fu out so pretends to get ready to step up and make a play but the agent said no no no n I can do it but then light hit him with the how can I trust you move which prompted the agent to give out his government ID with his name on it anyway light faked the robber out by giving him a page of the death note and the rule about the Death Note is that once somebody sees the book or the page they touch it they can see the Shinigami so the robbers saw it tweaked out ran off the bus and died light is out here playing chess and this is only episode four my [ __ ] anyway so he ran up on ra the FBI guy and was like Hey do what I say I'mma sleep you your [ __ ] your mom's your dad your sister him him her him bodies bodies bodies and you would think that since he's FBI he's really about that [ __ ] he ain't never scared of nothing but my man's was on that subway station singing like Mariah Carey on We Belong Together what the [ __ ] that man light told him he was going to knock off his girl and he wrote down the first middle and last name of the whole Squad no hesitation and he thought afterwards he was home free but light was like SC scamed [ __ ] I heard pop smoke was performing a set at rolling clouds go tell them what's anyway back on the police H [ __ ] is trying to abort the mission cuz they is not [ __ ] with L at all it was in there like 50 deep and chief Yami was like you know what y'all can leave if y'all want to I don't blame you ain't nothing going to stop you I ain't going to stop you you ain't going to get fired nothing that y'all can go if y'all want to and it wasn't nothing but like five [ __ ] left and one of them even said ah [ __ ] my fault I was AFK let me leave game so they finally unlocked the L face reveal and they was like yo this [ __ ] kind of ugly boy what the hell is this posture this school threat ass posture impolite ass posture hly want to crack her ass posture anyway pretty much he just said he was trying to cook up a plan to expose K but as always if one of these [ __ ] is one step ahead of the other the other is two steps ahead of the other one anyway the f agent girl was trying to find the truth behind her boyfriend's death and she said she had some leads on the situation so light walked in there and hit her with the helpful RZ stop with that corny [ __ ] my [ __ ] God damn well you shut up it's been two years you don't never leave me alone God shut up anyway they chop it up for a while and she reveals that she knows about the fact that K can kill without using a heart attack and she also revealed that she was with Ray and light realized he just got caught up so he's like damn I got to get this [ __ ] gone writes her name on the page and starts hitting his end of match dialogue dumbass should have never dropped the cover me now you and your husband are going to have te Queen WIS b anyway she gave him a fake name cuz she was being cautious about sharing her name after what happened to her husband obviously so now he's panicking cuz if she runs to the feds it's over so he tells her she can't go to the task force cuz the cops won't allow it and she was like why so this dumbass was like yeah I'm actually a part of the task force and then he started going on and how he was handpicked to be a part part of an elite group and everything and she was like nah gang I'm good I know L plus I work for the FBI what the hell now light was scrambling so he started kissing ass and she started feeling him and and he asked her to be a part of the task force and she agreed and gave him her actual ID this [ __ ] just turned water into [ __ ] wine actually no I take that back he just turned [ __ ] into wine this is the LeBron James of lying right here then light had to throw her off right quick so he said you know you're young you're beautiful you should be living your best life and she was like nah I'm ready to die about this [ __ ] man sign me up that manuk was in the back laughing his ass off he was like damn [ __ ] I ain't going to lie you cold for that one that was an Oscar performance oh [ __ ] damn and then she was like why are you checking your watch [ __ ] not going to lie I'm kid and you see this [ __ ] right here man she couldn't do nothing but walk away that's the face of somebody that knows they just played themselves anyway the detectives in the War Room were watching game film and they peep that Ray had the envelope and then they get the call that his fiance got packed so Ed was like nah [ __ ] that I need cameras in all y'all [ __ ] cribs meanwhile light was deleting his browser history and making some [ __ ] to hide the pages of the Death Note with his hand and ruk was like you're probably popular with the ladies aren't you get it what the [ __ ] are you talking about anyway since there was so many cameras in the house Ry couldn't eat apples in the open because to the naked eye they would just look like they're floating you know so he was telling like like yo I'm a junkie dog the same way [ __ ] be tweaking over perks it's the same way I tweak over over apples like like I will really crash out over this apple [ __ ] no Steve Jobs my [ __ ] so light told him to go find all the cameras and then look for a blind spot and he did just that and found 64 cameras in lights room alone but light had a plan since he wrote all the deps in advance he doesn't have to do [ __ ] in his room but look at Playboy magazines and do school workor all the while bodies dropping more frequently than NBA young boy this plan is so foolproof and light is rightfully feeling himself so you know what he's gonna do he's gonna take a chip and eat it real [ __ ] power move right there let's [ __ ] go anyway Al was kind of annoyed that the surveillance resulted in inconclusive evidence so he decided to move in on light now light was taking his entrance exams for college and then out of nowhere twirling his toes what the [ __ ] L is sitting there looming dangerously and then eventually the test end and they ask the two top scores to go up there and it's ell and light but then L told him yo I'm L you want to come work for me and then light was [ __ ] perplexed he didn't know what to do anyway they got caught in a side quest and started playing tennis and light was lowkey overthinking it cuz he was like should I win but if I win he's going to think I'm a competitive person and he might get the idea that I'm kah so I should lose but no if I lose he'll think I'm tanking on purpose which will make him think that I'm kill anyway he drops that [ __ ] off and then they go to a restaurant and he makes him take a test to decide if he's smart enough to be on the team and he fails but only because L rigged the game but then he was like I think you're Kira and even if you were it doesn't change anything in fact it would help if you were on my team which that don't make no damn sense at all but anyway they get a call and light's dad actually had a heart attack what the [ __ ] and L was just saying the light afterwards like hey you might be all right but you might not be all right but you might be peace anyway they in the War Room trying to figure out what the [ __ ] happened with Naomi and they cut on the TV what's cracking y'all it's your boy s to the kitty P to the enus on the real talk show the realest talk show on the [ __ ] planet and I'm sitting right here with the man the myth the legend K what what's his last name we don't know his last name but but we we got tapes from Kira and we about to play them [ __ ] check it out what's good with y'all young boys hey man y'all know that weatherman on channel 17 guess what in 5.8 seconds he's going to be heading to a meeting with the higher ups while his body is begging him to come back flip to that [ __ ] oh what the [ __ ] you know what here go one more for y'all damn he's really standing on business but look man I'm really just trying to get rid of this crime [ __ ] so y'all got to let me cook for real I'm only doing this for the good of the people but if you cross me every last one of y'all is going to get put on a shirt [ __ ] I am not playing y'all better tell 12 they got 4 days to cooperate otherwise I'm renovating this whole country bye ell and the gang was in panic mode one of their mans got slept and everybody was tweaking light's Mama went back to his room to check on his dad but he dipped grabbed him a truck and literally crashed out over this K [ __ ] he walked up on a producer and was like Hey cut that [ __ ] the [ __ ] off but the producer was like Noah no no no no he's going to sleep all of us if we do we can't do that [ __ ] I'll sleep you turn it off that man's heart is on one HP and he is running around like he is Pock anyway they decided no obviously so K gave the ultimatum that either the DEA or L had to give up but hold on though light was in the crib just as confused as the rest of the citizens cuz he did not send that [ __ ] you got to remember though light did not accept the 360 which would have allowed him to see the names without interacting with them but n it's another person with the not so light was like damn I got to join the task force so I can keep track of L anyway it's revealed that this girl right here Misa ammane is the second death note holder and she's a model I think she just wants to follow kir cuz she [ __ ] with with the vision anyway they had like analyzing the tapes and [ __ ] and while they thinking he's cooking up some crazy theory he was like damn it this [ __ ] is sorry as [ __ ] what is he doing then they get a message from Misa and she starts talking crazy about the Shinigami eyes and everything else and while L was tweaking light was in his head like yo what the [ __ ] my [ __ ] who who who is this he's a bot so anyway Misa left k a message and light was like [ __ ] bro I got to meet this [ __ ] before he [ __ ] some [ __ ] up so he heads to ayama with another member of the task for and he was like okay I can find him in the area and maybe chop it up with him but he won't be able to find me so L won't be able to suspect me again what an airtight plan man I'm such a [ __ ] G found him and then she drops a new tape saying she found him and this punk ass [ __ ] right here says hm it actually could be light man you know what I got some thoughts and theories but I'mma save it to the end of the video cuz L got it coming just know that so she pulls up on him and they go to his room and she basically declares her undying loyalty to him because he killed kill the guy who killed her parents and she even said that she would be his girlfriend and this man got up hugged her and was like yes a girl I can use her take advantage of her with my power mentally though not sexually because I respect wom yes you're going down L anyway he was trying to strategize and [ __ ] and she was like okay I'll do whatever you say but on one condition you have to go on a date with me you're this dumbass [ __ ] all right look we can't do that because El already suspects me damn I heard he was like the best of the best when it came to being a detective but I didn't know he was this get off his dick so then as light Was preparing to facilitate L's downfall L showed up at this [ __ ] University started trying to hang out with him while he was talking to the hoes man we all got that one man's who don't know when to let people cook anyway after that he seemed to get a handle on the situation but guess who showed up again [ __ ] Misa and she drew a crowd cuz you know she's a celebrity but this weirdo cop the feel but light was like wait I can use this hold on cuz Misa sees the names of the people right so it's still GG's all he got to do is hit her line and L cook that [ __ ] but after that he got a call and told like hey um we arrested your [ __ ] cuz we know she's the second kid so they started interrogating Misa but she forfeited the Death Note as well as her knowledge and memory of using it and since light realized he was probably next he did the same thing then light's dad was like I can't serve on this team anymore given that my son is a prime suspect it's a conflict of interest yes that's true so will you send me to solitary confinement not exactly you Mr Yagami are sentenced to spend every moment of the day with your wife until further noticed no no I'm [ __ ] with y'all they locked his ass up too anyway L had them in there for like 50 days and nothing came from that [ __ ] bodies was still dropping like flies light was tweaking Misa trying to sell her body light's dad looking like a 60-year-old Levi the other members of the task force are telling Al to Let It Go but L still being an [ __ ] cuz he don't have no evidence which he hasn't had the entire show he's just a sore loser so he was like fine and he had light's dad put on an Oscar worthy performance as a last gas but light yamy is a hood Olympics gold medalist and interrogation he did not fold so L being the sore loser that he is he made light stay by his side 247 light was not [ __ ] with that at all so they got to squabbling and [ __ ] but anyways it turns out that the members of the company called Yuba have gained access to the death Noe and they're knocking folks off like like to the point where they told the police hey drop the investigation and we not going to kill nobody and so they do that and the task force has an ideology off and isawa was like nah man [ __ ] this [ __ ] [ __ ] L [ __ ] light and his dad [ __ ] that [ __ ] who gave me double Co law instead of double fries and Zach be and [ __ ] the Boston Celtics uh you left your wallet shut the [ __ ] up thank you anyway matuda was tired of being treated like the water boy like like no funny [ __ ] he's a whole member of the task force and L had that [ __ ] doing coffee runs so he said [ __ ] all that [ __ ] Leroy dring so he got caught up and was about to get clapped so he called up Misa and set up a kickback and they got there and was like I ain't going to lie shouldn't we have killed this [ __ ] already I mean yeah but are we really about to stand here and let all this ass go untapped good point so Matsu to set up a had them pull up to the new building where L&M was at got fake drunk and then fake killed himself and it came back with Vital Information he was cooking so hard this episode that they named the whole episode after him dog but despite that fact and this big ass University of Alabama Jumbotron showing them talking about sleeping [ __ ] in 12K 1080p 60 FPS saying they're about to renovate the city this [ __ ] guy is like I still think it's light so they was like you know what let's cook up a plan to figure out their goals and [ __ ] so they cooked up a script for this con man to use against Misa and she'd answer questions in an attempt to gain info but while she was at the interview Rim the Shinigami pulled up on her and told her hey the dude that's K he's trying to tap that [ __ ] do not [ __ ] with him and she's like nah [ __ ] that I got a plan [ __ ] with him fake being the second kider and got him to confirm that he's the current kider everybody on the team is cooking right now except for the one [ __ ] who was hired by the United Nations to but you know what I'm save my thoughts for the end of this anyway so now that we know that higuchi is the current ker a plan was set in motion to arrest his ass and they had matu to go on TV and fake like he was going to reveal his identity forcing him into a corner where he could either reveal himself or just simply get arrested so my man starts going crazy he was speeding all over the city trying to knock off Mata and he finally got to the broadcast room but realized it was a trap pop lights pops and started running again like he actually had five stars like this is crazy dog he got caught up on the highway again but L's mans popped his tires and his Blake man is finally over bro we have taken down the king of the Death Note let's [ __ ] go apparently light had this whole [ __ ] set up months back he dropped a possession of the Death Note had the other one buried he told the sh got me to give the non bury one to a businessman and then alter the rules to them which absolved light and Misa of all crimes however once he regained his memories he told mea to go dig up the other one and write down Al's name so they could sleep his ass Al knew it was J too they had the bells ringing his backstory slideshow was playing they had him standing in the rain he was massaging light's feet wait what he was massaging light's feet hey yo anyway Al was about to prove that 13-day rule [ __ ] was a lie but light was like you can prove that [ __ ] to God Allah or whoever you serve cuz I hereby sentence you to assist the crash tell XXX to talk his mom is still exploiting him [ __ ] they clapped L's OG too that boy light don't got no comp no more but he had to sell it so check the Oscar winning performance right here it's officially lover guys that's that's that's going to do it for this video man yo who the [ __ ] okay so apparently L has some young boyss and this is near and this is Carmelo Anthony and all you need to know is that Carmelo is a crash dummy and near is basically Kobe to 's Jordan but Al was supposed to choose a success essor or or number two or whatever and he died before he got the chance but this old head selects near and melon leaves Hogwarts so now some time has passed like got his crib he's got his girl that he's unfortunately stuck with for life [ __ ] still dying life is good man boom police chief captured boom police chief dead then like sister got kidnapped by Carmelo Vin Diesel and Derrik Henry then they told L's Dad hey if you want your daughter back cuz you got to come to La you heard me and then like called near trying to collab but near was like this is l okay buddy good one I'm on my own and I'm on your ass but they realized since they were both after the death note they might as well work together so they decided to both head to LA to try and rescue light's sister and catch the culprit but then light's dad got extorted and they took the Death Note no problem and Carmelo slept everyone on near Squad anyway he gave the note he had to his pops had his pops cut the deal but he also had him go and try to get the other one back but [ __ ] turned into a [ __ ] gang war and so his dad pulled up on Carmelo and light thought he had the game in the bag but he got his dad is a pure bot and like essentially just gave Rudy go B the ball at the three-point line and told him to pull that [ __ ] for game and then this man's father got met with 100 shells and this man pulled up so Melo blew up the spot and light's dad was sent back to the lobby anyway George Bush went on the stand and was like this is a direct message to K uh you got it be we do not want no smoke no more you you got that [ __ ] those cowards [ __ ] yes I won so that move by President Bush this banned near his little group but he decided to keep it pushing regardless then Carmelo showed up and told him that the rule about the 13-day [ __ ] was a lie so he called up light and was like hey bro you know I know right no what what you mean it's you bro and light had no response for that [ __ ] right so do you know what this [ __ ] did to retaliate all this intellectual Warfare going on this entire show and this man [ __ ] swatted him doxed him didn't even try to play it off either he was like damn near I heard you in a tight situation right now be that's tough after that though ISO was thinking hm maybe like wasn't a crew mate after all and so he called up near and started singing didn't even have to get hit with the McDonald's bribe nothing and with all that information near pretty much confirmed that light was K then he went to search light and misa's house but he didn't find [ __ ] cuz light gave the note to his number one dick rider and he started cooking and he was cooking so much that he knocked off the spokesperson for Cara so then he had to go get a new person and he picked lights ex kyomi but like I said he was overcooking so light had to tell BR to chill out he couldn't contact him directly since isaa was watching him so he decided he was going to put in that call you up light I got a hotel for the night come through wait don't you have a girlfriend see you're asking too many questions pull up man [ __ ] what's good baby so of course he [ __ ] cooked got in contact with his supporter and secured the number two spot on his roster anyway back at HQ near G the gang a call and he was like Hey there k Sorry L since you don't want to admit it I'm in your hood now I wonder how long it's going to take me to find you and I want y'all to look at this [ __ ] right here cuz he's been in Japan for less than 24 hours right and look how quickly he connected the dots something that a certain person with only one letter in his name couldn't do you know what hold up a few more minutes y'all anyway Mis and kyomi were having a my man off but while that was going on this [ __ ] bot killed this predator an electrical and broad daylight and got caught in 4k it's yagam over then kyomi started pressing light about Misa and while that was going on they match mikami's death no handwriting to the work handwriting that he had and yeah man them walls closing in like might be that time near called him and was like Hey gang it's time oh it's time yeah it's time 1 p.m. a word by the shed let's [ __ ] it let's do it yeah let's do it then he gave kiomi the order to cook but right as she was getting ready to go to work Melo and his crew came in and kidnapped her and Melo ran off but this man got cornered and was like y'all got me but this is a country with very strict gun laws so I know y'all ain't going to shoot anyway mow took her to this location and told her to strip and while he was driving she cooked his [ __ ] and sent that crash dummy back to the lobby anyway she was was begging like to save her and he was like did you do it I mean yeah but okay bye he wrote her name down cuz y'all already know # no evidence you feel me anyway it's finally time for the Meetup they get there and near is sitting there masked up and he says they need to wait some time to confirm K isn't among them how long is this going to take anyway he was like the second K is on his way here and he's going to write down our names but we switch out his notebook with fake pages and light was over there grinning like [ __ ] cuz he was like yeah I really am the greatest chess player ever everything you thought of near I thought of that [ __ ] three times already [ __ ] I am him not them him and you're going to die in 3 2 1 game over near and then near was like got your dumbass and so light there what everyone who has ever been caught in 4k being impostor has done no no no [ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] that [ __ ] don't believe a word this [ __ ] say he's lying he killed and self-reported N hell no but what he didn't realize is that when he said looks like I win his mic was still on and so now this man has officially been caught and instead of just taking his l no pun intendent he tried to have an ideology off but nobody was trying to hear that [ __ ] especially matu get his ass out I really don't know how the [ __ ] he got up and ran off well I mean I guess he is the main character so she he should have plot armor Anyway ruk said well it's been real my [ __ ] and uh that's how Death Note ended man overall I've give this [ __ ] a eight out of 10 but it should have ended on like episode 14 L laet has to be the stupidest smart ass in the history of anime television real life existence this man suspected light as being ker practically the whole time they knew each other right and not once did he think H maybe I should just prosecute this [ __ ] I know what y'all are thinking miles you can't do that you can't just prosecute somebody off of Suspicion alone like what if they first of all shut up second the Central Park 5 was a case back in like 1980 Something where these five kids was accused of sexually assaulting a woman right and they were arrested with very little hesitation and very little evidence now they were wrongfully convicted but my point is that it's not past the police to just lock people up off of Suspicion alone but miles there wasn't enough convincing evidence against light to overpower the evidence that cleared light okay take the OJ case for example right it was evidence that cleared him right like the whole glove [ __ ] I think there wasn't no DNA on it but even with all of that it's a general consensus that it's a 85 90% chance he did that [ __ ] right so I say all of that to say even if there was decent evidence to clear like the fact that he kept finding evidence against light should have been enough to just say [ __ ] it and deal with them but instead this sleep deprived Hungry Hungry Hippo pale bastard would get all the evidence and be like H he did do that one thing that guilty [ __ ] don't do so he's clear I guess but then when all the suspicion is off like he'd be like nah it's you bro [ __ ] troll for 19 episodes just to die and have his young buy solve the case in like 2.5 episodes over half the near Saga was just him stacking evidence against light he damn near New instantly [ __ ] dumb ass just sat in the chair looking awkward as hell hair greasy as [ __ ] probably toes all out on the floor matter of fact I'm going to show y'all exactly how this [ __ ] should have gone down in the form of an Among Us game all right L you called the meeting so what's good who do you think it is not going to lie I think it's life what L we talked about this bro Mata saw me turn on lights damn you're right never mind you're clear what L what the [ __ ] bro what near it's obviously light how he turned on the lights why would he be an imposter my bad y my mic was off K me I cook better than you and after that meal who does he go to bed with damn you're going to go for that Misa Misa One mic [ __ ] like what T have you done I turned the little things up in that area to the right yeah shut the [ __ ] up vote this [ __ ] out any last words light so y'all are just going to believe this [ __ ] blindly and what if he's the impostor you know what [ __ ] it I can't play with y'all smooth brain ass [ __ ] vote me out there since y'all apparently love dick riding [ __ ] as soon as they join the [Music] MI I wish I did me she said still F I don't know why"
